But guard the seed
Her face is cracked from smiling
All the fears that she's been hiding
And it seems pretty soon everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting
Cheering winners who are losing
And she worries if their days are few
And soon they'll have to go
She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money took my car
Started tellin' her friend she' gon' be a star
I don't know but I've been told
A biglegged woman ain't got no soul
All I ask for all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies make me a happy man
Hey hey mama said the way you move
I heard the word I couldn't stay oh
I couldn't stand it another day another day
Another day another day
Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip
Throw down the key
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit
Every breath I take oh oh oh oh oh
Oh every move I make
Oh baby please don't go oh
Ay ay ay ay ay ay
You hurt me to my soul oh oh oh oh oh
You hurt me to my soul oh oh oh oh oh
Darling please don't go
We close our eyes
When it's dark
It's all because ofyouI'm feeling sadand blue
Her style is new but the face is same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes a different smile
Like that of one who knows
Ooh yeah it's been ten years and maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field
And I hear them shouting under my feet
And I know it's got to be real
Oh Lord deliver me
All the wrong I've done
Oh you can deliver me Lord
I only wanted to have some fun
Oh hear the angels marching hear them marching
Hear them marching hear them marching the marching
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you oh
As I walk down the highway
All I do is sing a song
And a train that's passin' my way
Helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong it's oh so strong
I'm just a simple guy
I live from day to day
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Makes me wonder what I did
Before we synchronized
Oooh featherlight suspension
Konis couldn't hold
I'm so glad I took a look
Inside your showroom doors
Greasy slicked down
Groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road
Mama it ain't nosin
Ayou've been yearnin'
Baby I been learnin' learnin' learnin'
All them good good good times
I've been misearnin'
Away way down inside
Woman you need love
I'd like to give ya every inch of my love
I'd like to give everybody my love ahh
You've been learnin'
Baby I've been yearnin'
Blistering of Earth
Terminateits worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Oh Never
No Never
I shall pass
The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again
He thinks the answer is cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He's been fooled again
The lies tempt her and she follows
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express
Do you take what I take
Sweetness obscure
Abide abide
Secrets inside
Deprive deprive
To feel so alive
Obey obey
Just don't turn away
In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Out of the way and you're kept to yourself
Ooh can't you see that he's not here
He doesn't want the attention you give
Ooh unplugging from it all
Invisible kid floats alone in his room
Ooh what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and around himself
Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the Earth
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Hell is worth all that natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
Yeah Table Table
Adrenaline crash and suck my cock
Nitro junkie paint me DED
And I see black and whiiiiiiiiiiite
One hundred plus through solo C
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world
You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside Ifeelto scream
Just floats away
Rebel finds it hard to leave
What makes you stay
He takes the poison ink
Signing life away
Then takes the dirty spoon
And digs his grave
Renegade fights the fight
That no one wins
He claims a crown of thorns
As friends and neighbors turn away
And theres a change that even with regret cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty of history in shades of grey
I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels likemorethan a lifetime
Feelslike more than a lifetime
Sometimes Iget tired of the waiting
Dear oh dear oh will they really laugh at me
Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain
Hes never been the same
No one is to blame
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the Queen
His boots were very clean
The path you tread is narrow and the drop is shear and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tubetrain up your spine
Did you see the frightened ones
Did you hear the falling bombs
Did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath the clear blue sky
Did you see the frightened ones
Did you hear the falling bombs
The flames are all long gone but the pain lingers on
Didididid you see the frightened ones
Are there any queers in the theater tonight
Get them up against the wall
There's one in the spotlight he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
That one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon
Who let all of this riffraff into the room
There's one smoking a joint
And another with spots
If I had my way
My patron saint is afighting with a ghost
Hes always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is atellin me I love ya still
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Wont you let me in your room one time fore I finally disappear
Everybodys wearing a disguise
To hide what theyve got left behind their eyes
The hour's getting late
Hey
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well uh outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Depart from me this moment
I told her with my voice
Said she But I dont wish to
Said I But you have no choice
I beg you sir she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth
I will secretly accept you
And together well fly south
Just then Tom Paine himself
Came running from across the field
Your babies are crying louder now
Its apoundin' on your brain
Your wifes screams are stabbin' ya'
Like the dirty drivin' rain
Your grass is turnin' black
Theres no water in your well
Your grass is turnin' black
Theres no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells
To Jerusalem
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Well I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
Well if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
Id forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'
Well I might be gone a long old time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there somethin' I can send you to remember me by
Swing too early or too late
Got to eat what Catfish serve
The cats in the well the gentle lady is asleep
Cats in the well the gentle lady is asleep
She aint hearing a thing the silence is astickin her deep
The cats in the well and grief is showing its face
The worlds being slaughtered and its such a bloody disgrace
The cats in the well the horse is going bumpety bump
The cats in the well and the horse is going bumpety bump
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
There lingers still though we're far apart
A taste of honey A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
She thinksof him and so she dressesin black
And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black
I think of her but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim she thinks of him
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
Ifitmakes you feelalright
I'll get you anything my friend
Ifit makes you feel alright
I told you so
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like the FBI
And the CIA
And the BBC
BB King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby dig it dig it
I'm in love with you ooh
Listen Do da do
Do you want to know a secret Do da do
Do you promise not to tell Do da do Whoa oh oh
Closer Do da do
Let me whisper in your ear Do da do
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you ooh
Ooh
Listen
You want her you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
You stay home she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone she doesn't need him
Your day breaks your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her
Free as a bird
