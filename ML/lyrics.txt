Factory airconditioned
Heat begins to rise
Guaranteed to run for hours

Grooving on the freeway
Gauges all are red
Gun down on my gasoline

Every hundred miles

You're gonna boogie night and day
Yeah caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree so fine let's hear it
Yeah all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling never sad so fine
Yeah if the wind was so right
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right so fine
Yeah can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on
Everybody
Yeah of one thing I am sure
It's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my dog's so fine
Yeah ain't but one thing to do
Spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew so fine
Sisters of the wayside bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of brightness no intruder dared upon
To jeopardize the course upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun
As love in the halls of plenty overrun
Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within the wall their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy that kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed
But no one seemed to question in anyway
How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat too smug to lift a hand
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'
But no one there had heaven within their reach
Where was your word where did you go
Where was your helping where was your bow bow
Dull is the armour cold is the day
Hard was the journey dark was the way way
I heard the word I couldn't stay oh
I couldn't stand it another day another day
Another day another day
Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip
Throw down the key
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed
They had to stay
Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the beat
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed
Her face is cracked from smiling
All the fears that she's been hiding
And it seems pretty soon everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting
Cheering winners who are losing
And she worries if their days are few
And soon they'll have to go
She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
Then she wonders what it's all about
When they break down the door
Her name is Brown or White or Black
You know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy
As the winners toll the bell
There is a train that leaves the station
Heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere
Has increased a dollar more Yes it has
And if you walk you're gonna get there
Though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan oh yeah
Her face is cracked from smiling all the fears that she's been hiding
And she wonders pretty soon everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting cheering winners who are losing
And she wonders if their days are few and soon they'll have to go
She hears them talk of new ways to protect the home she lives in
She wonders what it's all about when they break down the door
Her name is Brown White or Black you know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy as the winners toll the bell
There is a train station heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere has increased a dollar more
And if you walk you're gonna get there though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance you will wring your hands and moan
Hey girl stop what you're doing
Hey girl you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you but I like it a lot
Won't you let me hold you let me feel your loving touch
Hey babe I got something I think you ought to know
Hey babe I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms yeah
I'm never gonna let you go 'cause I like your charms
Hey girl astop what you're doin'

Won't you let me hold you let me feel your lovin' charms
Hey girl I got something you ought to know
Ooh my baby I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms yeah
I'm never gonna let you go 'cause I like your charms
Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower I got my power
I got a woman who knows
Crazy ways are evident
By the way you wearing your clothes
Sipping booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow
You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar
So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower you are my power
You are my woman who knows
Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower I got my power
I got a woman who knows
Now crazy ways are evident
In the way you're wearin' your clothes
Sippin' booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow
You told your mam'er I'd get you home
But you didn't say I got no car
I saw a lion he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar
So dancing days are here again
As the evening starts to grow
I've got my flower I've got my power
You are my woman who knows
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below yeah
You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run 'round sweet baby Lord how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you baby here I come again
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby but you push me away
Don't know where you're going only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby I want you again
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman never bargained for you
Take it easy baby let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill
You hurt and abused tellin' all of your lies
Run 'round sweet baby Lord how you hypnotize
Tryin' to love you baby but you go on hurtin' so
Soul of a woman was created below
Every day I work so hard bringin' home my hardearned pay
Sweet little baby baby then you take it away
I wanna love you baby but you do me so bad
The worst little woman I once ever had I've got to quit you baby
Ma ma yeah
Ma ma ma
Oh
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Oh
Oh
Hey
Yeah
It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turned to you you smiled at me
How could we say no
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh the songs to sing
When we at last return again
Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen yeah
Into the sun the south the north
At last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd yeah
To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet yeah
Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow
Oh the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again
Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth earth
Oh oh oh oh oh
I know the way know the way know the way know the way
I know the way know the way know the way know the way
Should I fall out of love my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin
The cup is raised the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word my will to sustain
For me the cloth once more to spin
Yours is the cloth mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

Jimmy Page electric guitar
Oh let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I amatraveler of bothtime and space
To be where Ihave been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh oh
Oh oh
Ooh baby I been flying
No yeah mama there ain't no denying
Oh oooh  yeah I've been flying
Mama mama ain't no denying no denying
All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find trying to find where I've been
Oh pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My ShangriLa beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir
Oh father of the four winds fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh when I'm on when I'm on my way yeah
When I see when I see the way you stayyeah
Ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah when I'm down yeah

We close our eyes
When it's dark
It's all because ofyouI'm feeling sadand blue
You went away and nowmy life is filled with rainy days
And I love you so how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your love away from me
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near
Just like me they long to be
Close to you
There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am
Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time
You hung me on a line
Do you still do the twist
Do you find you remember things that well
I wanna tell you
Some go twisting every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell
You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around
And she said don't you want it
Don't you want cocaine cocaine cocaine
Hadn't planned to could not stand to
Try it fry it na na na na yeah
Heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned
Oh oh babe damned
Down in the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground
Oh hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said didn't mean to
Did not mean to ffail
You didn't plan it you overran it
You want do it you want to
You want do it when you want to
You want do it do it when you want to
When you blow it babe

Oh baby if you fake it mama
Baby fake with all your might
When you fake it mama

She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street ow girl
She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her alltime favorite
When I make my move to her room it's the right time
She's never hard to please oh no
She's a very special girl The kind of girl you want to know
From her head down to her toenails Down to her feet yeah
And she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends Girlfriends
In a limousine Going back in Chinatown
Three's not a crowd to her she says Menage
Room  I'll be waiting a trois
When I get there she's got incense wine and candles menage
It's such a freaky scene a trois
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake watch out
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never never never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard hard hard as it seems
In the days of my youth I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try I find my way into the same old jam
Sixteen I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear I lost another friend oh
When I done quit hollering baby
I believe I'll shake 'em on down
Get my babe won't be late
You know by that I mean ah seconds late
Ah must I holler
Must I shake 'em on down
Well I ain't no monkey
I can't climb no tree
No brown skin woman gonna make no monkey out of me
Yeah I ain't no monkey
Sure can't climb no tree
Listen mama put on your mornin' gown
Put in your nightshirt Mama
We going to shake them down
Must I holler
Must I must I must I shake them on down
Hey fellas have you heard the news
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long just watch an' see
How the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face is same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes a different smile
Like that of one who knows
Ooh yeah it's been ten years and maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
I'll just keep on rollin' along
With the grace of the Lord above
People talkin' all around
'Bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify please do
It's the way you call me another guy's name name name name name awww yeeahhh
Ohhhhh work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried
Well I just got into town today
To find my girl who's gone away
She took the Greyhound at the General Store
I searched myself I searched the town
When I finally did sit down
I find myself no wiser than before
She said we couldn't do no wrong
No other love could be so strong
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
Now she took my heart she took my keys
From in my old blue dungarees
And I'll never go to Texas anymore
I took her love at seventeen
A little late these days it seems
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for
I took her word I took it all
Beneath the sign that said UHaul
She left angels hanging round for more
I thought I had it all sewn up
Our love a plot a pickup truck
But folks said she was after something more
I never did quite understand
All that talk about rocking bands
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
Oh yeah they just rolled my doll right out the door
Why well they just rolled my doll right out the door
From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show
There's an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow
So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you stall
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master's call
Oh Satan and man
Said there ain't no use in crying
Cause it will only only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying
Was this the only world you had Oh oh
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do
When I give you all my love
Please please be true
I'll give you all I've got to give rings pearls and all
I'll give you all I've got to give rings pearls and all
I've got to get you together baby
I'm sure sure you're gonna call
Oh when's the last time I done asked you
Well they call me the hunter
That's my name
They call me the hunter
That's how I got my fame
Ain't no need to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun
How many more times barrel house all night long alright
How many more times barrel house all night long
Well I've got to get to you baby
So please come home
I can't quit you baby
Woman I think I'm gonna put you down for a little while
I can't quit you babe

I said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child
You built my hopes so high
Baby then you let me down so low
You built my hopes so high
Then ya let me down ya let me down ya let me down so low
Don'tcha realize sweet baby
Woman I don't know which way to go
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde sing and cry
Valhalla I am coming
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde sing and cry
Valhalla I am coming yeah
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

In my time of dying

Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh oh

Oh ooh yeah I've been flying
Mama mama ain't no denying no denying
Oh all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find trying to find where I've been
Oh pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My ShangriLa beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir
Oh father of the four winds fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

It's like I'm missin' her and I know she's missin' me Missin' me
It's been two years an a half in july will make it three Make it three
Walking in the park just the other day baby
What do you what do you think I saw
Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said
Hey boy do you wanna score
And you know how it is
I really don't know what time it was
Woah oh oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while
I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
And asked us said please hey would we care
To all get in line get in line
Well you know they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh oh oh
He said that his friends would all drop by ooh
Why don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see
And baby baby baby do you like it
There you sit sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting
Ah Not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming
Oh oh oh
I know that it's all a state of mind ooh No no no
If you go down in the streets
Today baby you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care
Really don't care don't care really don't
Which which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm going to do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly ooh
Oh nobody's fault but mine
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight
Devil he taught me to roll
Devil he taught me to roll
How to roll the lot you like
Brother he showed me the gong
Brother he showed me the ding dong ding dong
How to kick that gong to light
Got a monkey on my back
Mmmmmonkey on my back back back back
Gonna change my ways tonight
Oh nobody's fault but mine
Nobody's fault but mine
Trying to save my soul tonight

How to kick that gong to light
Got a monkey on my back
Mmmmmonkey on my back back back back
Gonna change my ways tonight
Close the door put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you oh
Close the door put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow fallshardand don't youknow
The winds of Thor are blowingcold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news thatmustgetthrough
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you oh
As I walk down the highway
All I do is sing a song
And a train that's passin' my way
Helps the rhythm move along
There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong it's oh so strong
I'm just a simple guy
I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
And blows my blues away
There's nothing more that I can say
But on a day like today I pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you
I'm so glad I'm living
Gonna tell the world I am
I got me a fine woman
And she says that I'm her man
One thing that I know for sure
Gonna give her all the loving
Like nobody nobody nobody nobody can
Standing in the noonday sun
Trying to flag a ride
People go and people come
See my rider right by my side
It's a total disgrace they set the pace
It must be a race and the best thing I can do is run
Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreaming of the day
He could turn and say
His wife was Annie Mae
With any man a game she would play
When Tom was out of town
She couldn't keep her dresses down
And so it was one day
People got to Annie Mae
Tom stood a gun in his hand
And stopped her running around
The leaves are falling all around time I was on my way
Thanks to you I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain and with it pain and it's headed my way
Ah sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though Our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on
Mine's a tale that can't be told my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor I met a girl so fair
But Gollum and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her her yeah
Ah there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh let me get it back let me get it back

From the window of your rented limousine
I caught your pretty blue eyes
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen
Painted lady in the city of lies
Clutching pages from your teenage dream
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise
Through the circus of the LA queens
How fast you learn the downhill slide
Lips like cherries and the brow of a queen
Come on flash it flash it in my eyes
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh
Hours hours and the moments in between
Oh baby I couldn't count the times
The fun of coming oh the pain in leaving
Baby dry those silver eyes

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh ooh and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes there are two paths you can go by but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
Your head is humming and it won't go in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady can you hear the wind blow And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway toheaven
Whenshe gets thereshe knows if the stores areall closed

To sing a song for you
I recall you used to say
Oh baby this one's for we two
Which in the end is you anyway
There was a time that I stood tall
In the eyes of other men
But by my own choice I left you woman
And now I can't get back again
Then as it was then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Flying skies of fortune each a separate way
On the wings of maybe downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes didnt have to go
But as the eagle leaves the nest got so far to go
Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had
Do you ever remember me baby
Did it feel so good
Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would
Through the eyes and I sparkle senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest the nest is in our soul
I don't know how I'm going to tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend the boy next door
I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town
And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry
It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low oooh oh
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize oh
These things are clear to all from time to time ooh
Oh oh
Ah talk talk talk talk
Hey
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us upon us upon us
But I know that I love you so ohhhh oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah upon us all upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain oh yeah
Uhh ooooh yeah yeah yeah
I had a dream oh yeah
Crazy dream oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song yeah
People won't you listen now
Sing along oh
You don't know what you're missing now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now push push yeah
Nanananana
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu Starbright
The song remains the same ooh yeah
I had a dream oh yeah
Crazy dream oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place Ineededto go
Hear mysong yeah
People won't you listen now
Singalong oh
You don't know what you're missing now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now push push yeah
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu Starbright
The song remains the same ooh yeah
Silent woman through the flames you come
From the deep behind the sun
Seems my nightmares my loving gun
Left me barely holding on oh
With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand
When we know the time has come
Lose my senses lose command
Feel your healing rivers run
Is it every time I fall
That I think this is the one
Ooh in the darkness can you hear me call
Another day has just begun
Another day yeah
Greasy slicked down
Groovy leather trim
I like the way you hold the road
Mama it ain't no sin
Ooh troublefree transmission

Konis couldn't hold
I'm so glad I took a look
Inside your showroom doors
Asked sweet mama let me be her kid
She said You might get hurt if you don't keep it hid
Well I know my baby if I see her in the dark
I said I know my rider if I see her in the dark
Now I'm going to Rosedale take my rider by my side
Still barrel house but it's on the riverside yeah
I know my baby Lord I said is really sloppy drunk
I know my mama Lord a brownskin but she ain't no plum
Uhhuh see my baby tell her tell her hurry home
Had no loving since my baby been gone
See my baby tell her hurry on home
I ain't had Lord my right mind
Since my rider's been gone
Hey she promises she's my rider
I want to tell you she's my rider
I know you're mine she's my rider
She ain't but sixteen but she's my rider
I'm going to Rosedale take my rider by my side
Anybody ask if you and me met I keep them satisfied
But uh see my baby tell her tell her to shake my milk
Ain't no Lord since you nowhere
Ah yeah
She's a kindhearted lady
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
Squeeze my lemon 'til the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze it so hard I'll fall right out of bed
Squeeze my lemon
'til the juice runs down my leg
I wonder if you know what I'm talking about
Oh but the way that you squeeze it girl
I swear I'm going to  fall right out of bed
Ah she's a good rider
She's my kindhearted lady
I'm going to take my rider by my side yeah
I said her front teeth are lined with gold
She's got a mortgage on my body got a lien on my soul
She's my brownskin sugar plum
Oh know I feel so strange looking out the door
Oh trying hard to change and can't let it go
Oh crying tears of pain hurting more and more
Oh every day's the same as you walk the floor
Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
Oh to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Oh is it long to wait is there much to pay
Oh sometimes it's hard waiting for the day
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost
As you stand alone do you wonder how
Can you step aside does it matter now
Every love that's changed spend it fully
In the eyes of the night was it hard to see
If it never fails in spite of it all
So you hide in the tears enter Walter's walk
Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost
As you stand alone do you wonder how
Can you step aside does it matter now
It starts out like a murmur
Then it grows like thunder
Until it bursts inside of you
Try to hold it steady
Wait until you're ready
Any second now will do
Throw the door wide open
Not a word is spoken
Anything that you want to do
Ah don't you feel the same way
Ah don't you feel the same way
But you don't know what to do
No time for hesitatin'
Ain't no time for hesitatin'
All you got to do is move
They say you're feeling blue well
I just found a cure
It's a thing you gotta do yeah
Now listen
Well you say your body's aching
Well I know that it's aching
Chill bumps come up on you
Yeah the funny fool
I love the funny fool
Just like fooling after school
And then you ask for medication
Who cares for medication
When you've worn away the cure
Go back to the country
Yeah go back to the country
Feel a change is good for you
When you keep convincing
Ah don't keep convincing
Well what's that creeping up behind a' you
It's just an old friend
It's just an old friend
And what's that he's got for you
And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand child come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be they say will be
And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be

If it keeps on raining levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining the levee's going to break
When the levee breaks we'll have no place to stay
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan oh

It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well oh well oh well

Lying cheating hurting that's all you seem to do

Yeah got some hell to pay you I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movement pulls you under
Ooh bite the bullet well hard
Yeah but I bite harder so go too far too far
Outta my way outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one into not one
Into your step but out of time
Headstrong what's wrong
I've already heard this song before
Down on the sun down and no fun
Down and out where the hell ya been
Damn it all down damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again
Stand tall can't fall
Never even bend at all before
Outta my way outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one into not one
Into your step but out of time
Headstrong what's wrong
I've already heard this song before
Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark rutted cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction feel  burn
Still life incarnation
Still life infamy
Hallucination heresy
Still you run what's to come what's to be
The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide you hide but will be found
Release your grip without a sound
Still life immolation
Still life infamy
Hallucination heresy
Still you run what's to come What's to be
My mother was a witch she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch for the tears I cried
Take her down now don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt can't hide my disgrace
As I watched my mother die I lost my head
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread
Taking no chances you come with me
I'll split you to the bone help set you free
On with the action now I'll strip your pride
I'll spread your blood around I'll see you writhe
Your face is scarred with steel wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before you smells so sweet
I'll make my residence I'll watch your fire
You can come with me sweet desire
My face is long forgot my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore take me home
My soul is longing for await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother sweep myself
My face is long forgot my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore take me home
Halls of justice painted green money talking
Power wolves beset your door hear them stalking
Soon you'llpleasetheir appetite theydevour
Hammer of justice crushes you overpower
Apathy their stepping stone so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds
Lady justice has been raped truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again make your deal
Just what is truth I cannot tell cannot feel
Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity
Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose feign perception
Grudges break your back
Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become
Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on
Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone thy fears shall humble
Swallow all your pride
Yeah
Come clean confess up
Tell all spill gut
Off the veil stand revealed
Show the cards
Bring it on
Break the seal
Ladies and Gentleman step right up and
See the man who told the truth
Let on load off
Confess cast off
At the mercy the cat is out
Drop the disguise
Spit it up
Spit it out
And now what you've all been waiting for
I give you He Who Suffers The Truth

Lock horns I push and I strive

Dawn death fight final breath
What don't kill you make you more strong

They scratch me they scrape me
They cut and rape me
Hit dirt
Shake tree
Split sky
Part sea
Draw Lead
Piss wine
Sink teeth
All mine
Stoke fire
Break neck
Suffer through this
Cheat on death
I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I dont love any of them
You have your feelings I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many many many more to take
Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I piss my dreams
That's because that's what it is
I have the drive I got the scope
If I if I if I could I give you a rope
Your love means zero to me
Im a passionateless wave upon the sea
Passionateless wave upon the sea
Im only young once
I want to taste it all and have fun
I have no real feelings in my soul
Where most have passion I got a hole
I really got nobody else
I want lovers like the rain
So many of them so much the same
Why do I cheat on me
You say you love me I know its true
But I I I dont love you
Slaves Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word
Live in fear
Faith of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait something must be done
Four hundred years
Now let my people go
Land of Goshen
Go I will be with thee
Bush of fire
Blood running red and strong
Down the Nile
Plague darkness three days long
Hail to fire
I rule the midnight air
The destroyer
Born I shall soon be there
Deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor
Final darkness
Blood lamb's blood painted door
I shall pass
The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So don't fool again
He thinks the answer is cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
He's been fooled again
The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
She's been fooled again
Sleep and dream of this
Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Come believe me
Wait wait patiently
Your deathblack wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me
Say is that rain or are they tears
That stained your concrete face for years
The crying weeping shedding strife
Year after year life after life
An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last
O peace at last
Hey babe don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation
And I can tell by his face
I am a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case
Hey baby wait a minute stop
Don't run away don't call a cop
I am not looking to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you
I can tell by your face
I am all over this place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case no time baby
Hey babe don't turn away
I am here tomorrow gone today
I don't know what you think your game is
I don't care if you want your name is
And I can tell by this face
You are all over the place
I can tell by his face
Move over for a damage case
Get the fuck over man
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred our bodies work as one
Bloody but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Slamming through don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life isn't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc you see
Step a little closer if you please
Snake I am the snake
Tempting that bite you take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind
Be not afraid
I've got what you need
Hunger I will feed
I see my reflection in the window
It looks different so different than what you see
Projecting judgement on the world
This house is clean baby this house is clean
I see my reflection in the window
This window clean inside dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
This house is clean baby this house is clean
He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath
He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving Earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive
He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes
Ha
I walked out of hell with no scratches or scabs
I be too modest feel half of my wrath
I shoot up your block and kill half of you af
Drown your bitch in the tub just to splash in the bath
Bitches to God I have mastered my craft
I get so high I could smack a giraffe
You rappers are trash
Labels say dumb shit like I need to smash
No shit think I rap for a pat on the back
Want the cash and those plaques
I burn down this bitch can of gas and a mag
Got my hand on a strap
I came out the dirt you can't sanitize that
Bitch I vandalize tracks ya
Fuck em all fuck em all gun em down watch em fall
I'm appalled I'm a fuckin beast rappers gettin mauled
Black jigsaw these niggas gettin saw'd
Chopper go BRAAOWW Break these bitches off
Mr Benton boy these niggas gettin soft
Execute the boss bodies gettin tossed
Murda murda murda find them on the mop
Ooh the flow is psychosis you know I'm ferocious
I used to scrape change off the sofas
I can die now bitch just hand me my roses
I got the juice like I'm sippin mimosas
I sleep with hoes that pose nude on the posters
My niggas in Paris I told you I'm cultured
Got rid of the fuck niggas know that I'm focused
Extended my clip for the smoke with the vultures you bitch
Yeah uh
I sleep with one eye open
Bitch I'm a headache need ibuprofen
Niggas think it's a game like I be jokin
Been through a lot of bullshit bet they wonderin how I be copin
Niggas get sprayed like you caught in the water my heart is harsh
My bars are dark you all just bark no bite get torn apart
It's the omen niggas bones get blown apart
Got a temper like Napoleon Bonaparte
East side while roamed put chrome to marks
Got a drum not the one that belongs to Lars
Maniac with the knife that's long and sharp
It's your favorite Bully in the mink they should put me in the clink
They don't want to see you win nigga pushin out the kinks
Your BM in my DM tell her hit me with your link
Bitch I'm washin blood stains off the hoodie in the sink
Ya I stomp out you niggas like cigarette butts
I'm sick of you mutts this nigga too much
Come pay me a fee to give Vinnie two fucks
You play with my family they see me go bust
Homicide homicide Mama I'm sorry
She did her best though the pain did not scar me
I am that fire ho this is Dracarys
King of the jungle I tear up safaris
Exit that light and come into the dark throw a brick off a bridge hope it crash in your car
Bitch I am Slash I will smash a guitar
These niggas arrest I ain't yappin with narcs
This is that ill flow my children I kill for
You copy that  get topped in a limo
No love for you weirdos I creep in your window and pop out your brain
You get smothered with pillows
Say your prayers little one
Don't forget my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in warm within
Keepyoufree from sin
'Tilthe sandman he comes
Sleep with oneeye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Say your prayers little one don't forget my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in warmwithinkeep you freefrom sin
'Til the Sandman he comes
Something'swrong shut thelight heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war dreams of liars dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite yeah
Feel no pain but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
Do you see what I see
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express
Do you take what I take
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward
Seems to me absurd
Do you fear what I fear
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose
More alternatives
Energy derives from both
The plus and negative
Do you need what I need
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside to each his own
Do you trust what I trust
Me myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen
I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence
Lengthen freedom's ring
Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Time is like a fuse short and burning fast
Armageddon's here like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing so take your last breath
Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins they make us humble
Only you can tell in time
If we fall or merely stumble
Mirror mirror upon the wall
Break the spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun on they run through the endless grey
On they fight for they're right
Yes but who's to say
For a hill men would kill
Why They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
Take a look to the sky just before you die

Just don't turn away
In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Goneinsane
On the way toparanoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer
Doomed design
Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading
Do you comprehend
Do you feel it terminating
In the end
My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You've turned this lie to truth
Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies
Infanticide
I've got to see you moving fast see you come my way
See the dreams Ihopethey last neverfade away
Got to see the lightsabove make it loud tonight
Got to see the thunder roarsetitall alight
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way
Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair
No life til leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fansstartscreaming it's right

We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain
Oh sweet pain yeah
No more
The crap rolls out of your mouth again
Haven't changed your brain is still gelatin
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about your self instead
Who are you Where you been Where you from
Gossip burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself
Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
It's not who you are it's who you know
Others' lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself
You can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence marks your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me I've always been this way
Not by choice just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of asome young boy
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder
Where you are
It might seem like Hell the river Styx
Your affection never sticks
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
A butterfly heart
Flies right past you
There is nothing to say
Nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Hey hey hey here I go now
Here I go into new days
Hey hey hey here I go now
Here I go into new days
Hey hey hey ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey hey hey ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey hey hey and I went
And I went on down that road
Hey hey hey and I went on
And I went on down that road
Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown
Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain
Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much
I hide inside
I hurt inside
I hide inside bull I'll show you
I'm OK just go away
Into distance let me fade
I'm OK just go away
I'm OK but please don't stray too far
Open your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
I'm beating right here
Right now
Open your heart
I'm beating right here
Open your mind
I'm beating right here
Right now
Ooh what a good boy you are
Out of the way and you're kept to yourself
Ooh can't you see that he's not here
He doesn't want the attention you give
Ooh unplugging from it all
Invisible kid floats alone in his room
Ooh what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and around himself
Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the Earth
To join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it's time for your fate and I won't hesitate
To pull you down into this pit
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
And from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I'm stalking you as prey
Living your life with me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong
Sitting in my room with my head in my hands
I just can't seem to move
I've gotta get up get out get high
Get back in the groove
There's a job to be done and I'm the one
You people chose to do it
Now I tight up my belt and see you are felt
It's time to get your way
Moving my hips in a circular way
Just forward a bit
Pull your body into my waist
And feel how good it fits
And there's a job to be done and I'm the one
You people chose to do it
Now I take off my pants see you chained to get down
It's your turn to wait
Sitting in my room with my head in my hands
I just can't seem to move
I've gotta get up get out get high
Get back in the groove
There's a job to be done and I'm the one
You people chose to do it
Now I tight up my belt and see you are felt
It's time to get your way
Would you come to me if I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave
Would you come to me Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you to help pull me up
The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating
Pull me up
Would you be my lord and saviour pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me on my lips
Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening
Now shoots out its tiresome message
Wont you pull me up
Scalding my dead father has the motor and he's driving
Towards an island of lost souls
Sunny a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or  oh state of grace
Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup the dream is over
Get the coffee turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad psychic savagery
The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Spineless from the start sucked into the part
Circus comes to town you play the lead clown
Marvel at his tricks need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came rotting your brain
Little dog who cant get in
Moaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb
Little dog who cant get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim
Pony legs little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot
The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away
Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog dont have much at all
A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick
If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog dont care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy
You could have a taste
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want
My small dog he want what I got
Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot
Pathetic little dog
The little man follows his nose
Counts his fingers and his toes
He still got those
Pathetic little dog
Following his nose
But it needs my money to buy
I am an up while youre a down
The spring and the will follow me around
While you sniff your shit in the wind
Money can do anything
Tell me what it is you want
Just tell me what it is you want
I am up while you are a down
The spring and the will follow me around

Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come come into my coven

Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I am king of pain I'm insane

Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I will be the first
To watch your funeral

And make love to shame

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metalization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy dirty and mean
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life's about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance
Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hardhitting heavy dirty and mean

One crown
Shines on through the sound
One crown
Born to lose
One man
Does not give a damn
One man
No excuse
One fist
Hammers through the mist
One fist
Steady on
One heart
Diehard from the start
One heart
Beats its song
Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in pull that pin
Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still
What makes me drift a little bit closer
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over
Worn to repeat until I feel
See through the skin the bones they all rattle
Future and past they disagree
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me
Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in pull that pin
Violate annihilate
Wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate exterminate
Life itself denied
You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world
You still stood there screaming
No one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You you'll take it on all yourself
Remember misery loves company
The motherfuckers got in my head
Trying to make me someone else instead
It's my world now
It's my world now
It's my world
It's my world
Mama why's it raining in my room
Cheer up boy clouds will move on soon
Heavy fog got me lost inside
Gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride
Who's in charge of my head today
Dancing devils in angels way
It's my time now
It's my time now
It's my time
Yeah it's my time
Look out motherfuckers here I come
Gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead
Need more and more to get into that space
Fuel more and more to get into that same damn place
Chase round and round follow the white brick road
Burn and never stop sinner spill into overload
Need more and more to get into that space
Fuel more and more to get into that same damn place
Chase round and round follow the white brick road
Burn and never stop sinner spill into overload
Need more and more to get into that space
Fuel more and more to get back to that same damn place
Chase round and round follow the white brick road
Burn and never stop sinner spill into overload
And it feels right this time
On this crash course with the big time
Pay no mindtothe distant thunder
Newday fills his head with wonderboy
Says it feels right this time
Turned around and found therightline
Goodday to bealive Sir
Good dayto be alive he said yeah
Dont it feel right like this
All the pieces fall to his wish
Sucker for that quick reward boy
Sucker for that quick reward they said
No mercy for what we're doing
No thought to even what we've done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We're ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift pulsing with the Earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep
Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill is the air cold as steel tonight
We shift call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift pulsing with the Earth

Roaming the land while you sleep
Bright is the moon high in starlight

Pulsing with the earth

Roaming the land while you sleep
Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill is the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside Ifeelto scream

I'm only happy when it rains
I'm only happy when it's complicated
And though I know you can't appreciate it
I'm only happy when it rains
You know I love it when the news is bad
And why it feels so good to feel so sad
I'm only happy when it rains
I'm only happy when it rains
I feel good when things are going wrong
I only listen to the sad sad songs
I'm only happy when it rains
I only smile in the dark
My only comfort is the night gone black
I didn't accidentally tell you that
I'm only happy when it rains
You'll get the message by the time I'm through
When I complain about me and you
I'm only happy when it rains
I'm only happy when it rains
You wanna hear about my new obsession
I'm riding high upon a deep depression
I'm only happy when it rains
Look my friends to the golden sign
Lonely folks giving me the eye
Sacrifice with the golden rod
The virgin queen to the newfound god
The offering to the deity
The only thing that their minds will see
Look my friends to the golden sign
Lonely folks giving me the eye
Sacrifice with the golden rod
The virgin queen to the newfound god
Offering to the deity
The only thing that their minds will see
Only way to feel the noise
Is when it is good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screaming with the crowd
On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head you must be dead
If it don't make you fly
Know your body's made to move
It goes straight to your spine
You got to move it
If it don't make you fly
Only way to feel the noise
Is when it is good and loud
So good Ican'tbelieve it
Screaming withthe crowd
On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head you must be dead
If it don't make you fly
Only way to feel the noise
Is when it is good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screaming with the crowd
On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head you must be dead
If it don't make you fly
There's a black cloud overhead that's me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree again it's me
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry
There's a dirty needle in your child haha stick me
Empty bottles still in hand still dead still me
I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more
I'm the fortyfive that's in your mouth I'm a dirty dirty whore
Yeah and he wants to be called father now me again me
The marks inside your arms spell me spell only me
I'm the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right as children play
Hey hey hey
Now see the black cloud up ahead that's me
And this poison ivy chokes the tree again it's me
And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes pushes makes it cry
If I pump out blood in the sunshine
Oil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away
A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass a little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that Im pumping away
Like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that Im pumping away
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that Im pumping away
If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas and I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream the trickle
The tributary of my heart
As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream the trickle
The tributary of my heart
Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out mercy
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me
Use a knife on me
Be shocked at the boldness the coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump in the manic confusion of love
Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old paint old looks
Cover up the past
White heat white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and I
Truth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash ghost white
Ultra clean
Wanna be skeleton
Clear eyes diamond eyes
Strip the past of mine
My sweet turpentine
Rebel grips the bottle tight
Just floats away
Rebel finds it hard to leave
What makes you stay
He takes the poison ink
Signing life away
Then takes the dirty spoon
And digs his grave
Renegade fights the fight
That no one wins
He claims a crown of thorns
To pierce the skin
He climbs his crucifix
And waits for dawn
Thinks they'll remember him
After he's gone
This rebel fights the fight
That no one wins
To claim a crown of thorns
To pierce his skin
Climbs his crucifix
And waits for dawn
He loses consciousness
The myth lives on
Guilty as charged but dammit it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat chilling cold as I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
Time moving slow the minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this Just get it over with
If this is true just let it be
Guiltyascharged but damnit ain't right
There's someone else controllingme
Death in the air strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat chilling cold as I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
Time moving slow the minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this Just get it over with
If this is true just let it be
Story starts quiet town
Small town boy big time frown
Never talks never plays
Different path lost his way
Then streets of red red I'm afraid
There's no confetti no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But oh my God how it all did change
I always said something's wrong
With little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles
Gallows calls son I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys how they soon change
Guess who
You bitches it's RiRi
LamLamborghini strawberry kiwi
Fashion week in Paris was nice
Every designer had my size ha ha ha ha ha ha haa
Switch my hair they gon' copy her

Back door because I am leaving

Switch my hair they gon' copy her
Switch my gear they gon' copy her
LLLook at how they stare just to copy her
Well roger that
Did you copy that cococopy cat
We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you to start up afight
There'san evil feelingin our brains
But it's nothing newyou know it drives us insane
There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You always been taking and now you're giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away 'cause you're the one we will find

I won't go away
Right Right here I'll stay
Stand silent in flames
Stand tall untill it fades
All these shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you
All the shots
All the shots
All the shots I take
What difference did I make
All the shots I take
I spit back at you
I won't go away with a bullet in my back
Right Right here I'll stay with a bullet in my back
Shoot me take a shot

These are the eyes that can't see me
These are the hands that drop your trust
These are the boots that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside
These are the ears that ring with hate
This is the face that I'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more
These are the legs in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's not so safe
This is the face you'll never change
This is the god that ain't so pure
This is the god that is that pure
This is the voice of silence no more
This is the face that stones you cold
This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
This is the voice of silence no more
This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the voice of silence no more
Saint Anger 'round my neck
Saint Anger 'round my neck
He never gets respect
Saint Anger 'round my neck
Saint Anger 'round my neck
Saint Anger 'round my neck
He never gets respect
Saint Anger 'round my neck
On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry
For freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night
Like paper doves in flight
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbors turn away
And theres a change that even with regret
Cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty of history in shades of grey
On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry for freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbors turn away
And theres a change that even with regret cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty of history in shades of grey
I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels likemorethan a lifetime
Feelslike more than a lifetime
Sometimes Iget tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of beinginhere
Isthis the waythat it's alwaysbeen
Could it ever have been different
Do you ever get tired of the waiting
Do you ever get tired of being in there
Don't worry nobody lives forever
Nobody lives forever
I will always be here
I will always look out from behind these eyes
Its only a lifetime
Its only a lifetime
Its only a lifetime
We don't need your adulation
We don't need your starry gaze
How the years have come between us
You should have seen them in the early days
Should have seen them in the early days
They don't need your reminiscing
They don't need your memories
They don't want to hear who's missing
You should have seen them when the boys were young
You should have seen them when the boys were young

I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No don't think I'll need anything at all
A cloud of eiderdown
Draws around me
Softening the sound
When night comes down you lock the door
The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change the wind is warm
Now wakes the owl now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream the dream is gone
Green fields a cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn
And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down
Lime and limpid green
A second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn Oberon Miranda and Titania
Neptune Titan
Stars can frighten
Lime and limpid green the sounds surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green the sounds surrounds
The icy waters underground
Lime and limpid greenasecond scene
A fightbetween the blue you once knew
Floatingdown the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and SaturnOberonMirandaand Titania

Blindingsigns flap
Flicker flicker flicker blam
Pow pow
Stairway scare Dan Dare whos there
Lime and limpid green the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground
Wasting my time
Resting my mind
And Ill never pine
For the sad days and the bad days
When we was workin from nine to five
Ive got a bike you can ride it if you like
Its got a basket a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
Id give it to you if I could but I borrowed it
Ive got a cloak its a bit of a joke
Theres a tear up the front
Its red and black Ive had it for months
If you think it could look good then I guess it should
I know a mouse and he hasnt got a house
I dont know why I call him Gerald
Hes getting rather old but hes a good mouse
Ive got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man there a man lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish Theyre on the dish
I know a room of musical tunes
Some rhyme some ching most of them are clockwork
Lets go into the other room and make them work
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more
The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade you make the change
You rearrange me 'til I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me
Breathe breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground
Run rabbit run
Dig that hole forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one
Breathe breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around andchooseyour own ground
Run rabbit run
Dig that hole forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one
Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own no no
Bring the boys back home
Bridges burning gladly merging with the shadow
Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher
Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way
Magic vision stirring
Kindled by and burning
Flames rise in her eyes
The door that stands ajar
The walls that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war
In
Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange red and blue
He found it in the zoo
Dear oh dear oh were they really sad for me
Dear oh dear oh will they really laugh at me
Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain
Hes never been the same
No one is to blame
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the Queen
His boots were very clean
The path you tread is narrow and the drop is shear and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tubetrain up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end Will the final couplet rhyme
A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in theres nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that theyre moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size
Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room
You got to be crazy you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while you can work on points for style
Like the club tie and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder and harder and harder
As you get older
Yeah and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer
And when you lose control you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone
Got to admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf dumb and blind you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends
How could you go
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night
How can you treat me this way
Running away
Ooooh babe
Why are you running away
All that you touch and all that you see
All that you taste all you feel
And all that you love and all that you hate
All you distrust all you save
And all that you give and all that you deal
And all that you buy beg borrow or steal
And all you create and all you destroy
And all that you do and all that you say
And all that you eat and everyone you meet Everyone you meet
And all that you slight and everyone you fight
And all that is now and all that is gone
And all that's to come and everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon
All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save
And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy

And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon
All this love is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small
All around I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear
Red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near
What shall we use to fill the empty spaces
Where we used to talk
How shall I fill the final places
How should I complete the wall
What shall we use to fill the empty spaces
Where we used to talk
How should I fill the final places
How should I complete the wall
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
Last sunlight disappears
Distant bells newmown grass smells
So sweet
By the river holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Children's laughter in my ears
Last sunlight disappears
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
The last sunlight disappears
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown
Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn
Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion
Screaming through the starlit sky
Traveling by telephone
Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown
Brezhnev took Afghanistan
Begin took Beirut
Galtieri took the Union Jack
And Maggie over lunch one day
Took a cruiser with all hands
Apparently to make him give it back
Did you see the frightened ones
Did you hear the falling bombs
Did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath the clear blue sky
Did you see the frightened ones
Did you hear the falling bombs
The flames are all long gone but the pain lingers on
Didididid you see the frightened ones
Didididid you hear the falling bombs
Didididid you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath the clear blue sky
Didididid you see the frightened ones
Didididid you hear the falling bombs
The flames are all long gone but the pain lingers on
Goodbye cruel world I'm leaving you today
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
Goodbye all you people there's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind goodbye
Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain
In the sky a bird was heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room
Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain
In the sky a bird is heard to cry
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room
Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore
She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her blind evry time
Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned
Heavy hung the canopy of blue
Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore
She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her cry evry time
du du du du du du du du du
du du du du du du du du du
Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned
Come in here dear boy have a cigar you're gonna go far
You're gonna fly high you're never gonna die
You're gonna make it if you try they're gonna love you
Well I've always had a deep respect an' I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic that is really what I think
Oh by the way which one's Pink
We're just knocked out we heard about the sellout
You gotta get an album out you owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count
Everybody else is just green have you seen the chart
It's a hell of a start it could be made into a monster
If we all pull together as a team
Come in here dear boy have a cigar you're gonna go far
You're gonna fly high you're never gonna die
You're gonna make it if you try they're gonna love you
Well I've always had a deep respect an' I mean that most sincerely

Hey you
Out there in the cold getting lonely getting old
Can you feel me
Hey you
Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me
Hey you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight
Hey you
Out there on your own sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me
Hey you
With your ear against the wall waiting for someone to call out
Could you touch me
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone
Open your heart I'm coming home
Hey you
Out there on the road always doing what you're told
Can you help me
Hey you
Out there beyond the wall breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me
Hey you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand divided we fall
Hey you out there in the cold
Getting lonely getting old
Can you feel me
Hey you standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me
Hey you don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight
Hey you out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me
Hey you with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me
Hey you would you help me to carry the stone
Open your heart I'm coming home
Hey you out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me
Hey you out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me
Hey you don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand divided we fall
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times
If I were a swan I'd be gone
If I were a train I'd be late
And if I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do
If I were asleep I could dream
If I were afraid I could hide
If I go insane
Please don't put your wires in my brain
If I were the moon I'd be cool
If I were a rule I would bend
If I were a good man
I'd understand the spaces between friends
If I were alone I would cry
And if I were with you I'd be home and dry
And if I go insane
Will you still let me join in with the game
If I were a swan I'd be gone
If I were a train I'd be late again
If I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion that space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand
Are there any queers in the theater tonight
Get them up against the wall
Against the wall
Now there's one in the spotlight he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
Against the
And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon
Who let all of this riffraff into the room
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way I'd have all of ya shot
So ya thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel that warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand
Are there any queers in the theater tonight
Get them up against the wall
There's one in the spotlight he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
That one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon
Who let all of this riffraff into the room
There's one smoking a joint
And another with spots
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot
Everybody wakes and in the morning
Hot tea and can't stop yawning
Pass the butter please
Have you ever read the Daily Standard
Reading all about the plane that's landed
Upside down
Everybody cares about the weather
And everybody should know better
What a waste of time
Everybody lives beneath the ceiling
Living out a dream that sends them reeling
To a distant place
Its awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And Im most obliged to you for making it clear that Im not here
And I never knew the moon could be so big
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And Im grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And Im wondering who could be writing this song
I dont care if the sun dont shine
And I dont care if nothing is mine
And I dont care if Im nervous with you
Ill do my loving in the winter
And the sea isnt green
And I love the Queen
And what exactly is a dream
And what exactly is a joke
Sunlight bright upon my pillow
Lighter than an eiderdown
Will she let the weeping willow
Wind his branches round
Every night I turn the light out
Waiting for the velvet bride
Will the scaly armadillo
Find me where Im hiding
Will the misty master break me
Will the key unlock my mind
Will the following footsteps catch me
Am I really dying
Into the distance a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a wind swept field
Standing alone my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen empty and turned to stone
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
There was a king who ruled the land
His Majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time
For all the time spent in that room
The dolls house darkness old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by
Money get away
You get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car caviar fourstar daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team
Money get back
I'm alright Jack keep your hands off of my stack
Money it's a hit
Ah don't give me that dogoodygood bullshit
I'm in the highfidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet
Money it's a crime
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise
That they're giving none away
Money get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car caviar fourstar daydream

Money it's a hit

Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
Money so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise
It's no surprise that they're giving none away
Away away away

Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb
Mother do you think they'll like this song
Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls
Ooh ah
Mother should I build the wall
Mother should I run for president
Mother should I trust the government
Mother will they put me in the firing line
Ooh ah is it just a waste of time
Mother do you think she's good enough for me
Mother do you think she's dangerous to me
Mother will she tear your little boy apart
Ooh ah
Mother will she break my heart
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to fly to fly to fly to
Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Fuck all that fuck all that
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
Theres too many home fires burning and not enough trees
Fuck all that

One two Free Four
One two Free Four
I can see the turning of the key
Ive been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but hes vain
Oh somethings atelling me I wear the ball and chain
My patron saint is afighting with a ghost
Hes always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is atellin me I love ya still
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Wont you let me in your room one time fore I finally disappear
Everybodys wearing a disguise
To hide what theyve got left behind their eyes
But me I cant cover what I am
Wherever the children go Ill follow them
I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you Im not free
How long must I suffer such abuse
Wont you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose
Ive given up the game Ive got to leave
The pot of gold is only makebelieve
The treasure cant be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me offa your list
My head tells me its time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but youre strange
One more time at midnight near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Wont you descend from the throne from where you sit
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it
Oh where have you been my blueeyed son
And where have you been my darling youngone
Ivestumbled on theside of twelve misty mountains
Ive walkedand Ive crawled on six crooked highways
Ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
Oh what did you see my blueeyed son
And what did you see my darling young one
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers ableeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw tenthousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And what did you hear my blueeyed son
And what did you hear my darling young one
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazing
I heard tenthousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
Oh what did you meet my blueeyed son
And who did you meet my darling young one
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman her body was burning
I met a young girl she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
And what will you do now my blueeyed son
And what will you do now my darling young one
Im agoing back out fore the rain starts afalling
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioners face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color where none is the number
And Ill tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But Ill know my song well before I start singing
Oh where have you been my blueeyed son
Oh where have you been my darling young one
I stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I walked and I crawled on six crooked highways
I stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
Been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
Oh what did you see my blueeyed son
Oh what did you see my darling young one
Saw a newborn baby with wild wolves around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers ableedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand takers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were danglin' from the vine
I was passin' by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind
Ain't talkin' just a'walkin'
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burnin' still yearnin'
No one on earth would ever know
They say prayer has the power to help
So pray from the mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I'm a'tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh mother things ain't goin' well
Ain't talkin' just a'walkin'
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
Heart burnin' still yearnin'
They'll be no mercy for ya' once you've lost
Now I'm all worn down by weepin'
My eyes are filled with tears my lips are dry
If I catch my opponents ever sleepin'
I'll just slaughter them where they lie
Ain't talkin' just a'walkin'
Through the world mysterious and vague
Heart burnin' still yearnin'
Walkin' a'through the cities of the plague
Well the whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down
Ain't talkin' just a'walkin'
Eatin' hogeyed grease in a hogeyed town
Heart burnin' still yearnin'
Someday you'll be glad to have me around
They will crush you with wealth and power
Every wakin' moment you could crack
I'll make the most of one last extra hour
I'll avenge my father's death an' I'll step back
Ain't talkin' just walkin'
Hand me down my walkin' cane
Heart burnin' still yearnin'
Got to get ya' out of my miserable brain
All o' my loyal and muchloved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road
Ain't talkin' just a'walkin'
My mule is sick my horse is blind
Heart burnin' still yearnin'
Thinkin' bout that gal I left behind
Well it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'
Who says I can't get heavenly aid
Ain't talkin' just a'walkin'
Carryin' a dead man's shield
Heart burnin' still yearnin'
A'walkin' a'with a toothache in my heel
The sufferin' is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm a'not playin' I'm not pretending
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears
Ain't talkin' just a'walkin'
Walkin' ever since the other night
Heart burnin' still yearnin'
Walkin' til I'ma clean outta sight
As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day a hot summer lawn
Excuse me ma'am I beg your pardon
There's no one here the gardener is gone
Ain't talkin' a'just a'walkin'
Up the road around the bend
Heart burnin' still yearnin'
In the last outback at the world's end
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'd only let your hair hang low
Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta what's on your mind
You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time
Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Oh my heart is so sad
Cause I want you so bad
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word
Hey
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But uh but you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin' falsely now
The hour's getting late
Hey
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well uh outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey
There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word

The hour's getting late
Hey
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well uh outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey
Yeah
I see jokers on my left thieves upon my right
Youd find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But Im still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black its too cold
Im all alone take me back to the roads
I had to roam to get here and Ill hitch back
Get a cab to my mothers house
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
Whats a brother for
When Im sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears full of war
I was a ploughman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs
Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an illmannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though
Thats why they live a lie
I dont think Ill ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a brothers at my side
Theres no trap door or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
Youve seen mine I think its time I see yours
I bet you that weve been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now Im trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics
Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I aint religious Im a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
Ive been a joker Ive been a thief Ive been a rapper
Ive been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter
Well if I had to do it all over again
Babe Id do it all over you
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years
Babe Id even do that too
Well a dogs got his bone in the alley
A cat shes got nine lives
A millionaires got a million dollars
King Sauds got four hundred wives
Well evrybodys got somethin
That theyre looking forward to
Im looking forward to when I can do it all again
And babe Ill do it all over you
Well if I had my way tomorrow or today
Babe Id run circles all around
Id jump up in the wind do a somersault and spin
Id even dance a jig on the ground
Well everybody gets their hour
Everybody gets their time
Little David when he picked up his pebbles
Even Sampson after he went blind
Well everybody gets the chance
To do what they want to do
When my time arrives you better run for your life
Cause babe Ill do it all over you
Well I dont need no money I just need a day thats sunny
Baby and my days are gonna come
And I grab me a pint you know that Im a giant
When you hear me yelling Feefifofum
Well you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle
You made me to a walkin wreck
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone
Then you knocked off my head from my neck
Well if Im ever standin steady
Adoin what I want to do
Well I tell you little lover that you better run for cover
Cause babe Ill do it all over you
Im just resting at your gate so that I wont be late
And momma Im ajust sitting on the shelf
Look out your window fair and youll see me squatting there
Just afumblin and amumbling to myself
Well after my cigarettes been smoked up
After all my liquors been drunk
After my dreams are dreamed out
After all my thoughts have been thunk
Well after I do some of these things
Im gonna do what I have to do
And I tell you on the side that you better run and hide
Cause babe Ill do it all over you
Old man sailing in a dinghy boat

Theres just gonna be you and me
Underneath that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah
Now whos on the table whos to tell me
Oh yeah
Whos on the table whos to tell me
Oh yeah
Who should I tell oh who should I tell
The fortynine of you like bats out of hell
Oh underneath that old apple suckling tree
As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paines
I spied the fairestdamsel
Thatever did walkin chains
I offered her my hand
Shetook me by the arm
I knew that very instant
She meant to do me harm
Depart from me this moment
I told her with my voice
Said she But I dont wish to
Said I But you have no choice
I beg you sir she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth
I will secretly accept you
And together well fly south
Just then Tom Paine himself
Came running from across the field
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield
And as she was letting go her grip
Up Tom Paine did run
Im sorry sir he said to me
Im sorry for what shes done
You been down to the bottom with a bad man babe
But youre back where you belong
Go get me my pistol babe
Honey I cant tell right from wrong
Go down to the river babe
Honey I will meet you there
Go down to the river babe
Honey I will pay your fare
If youre looking for assistance babe
Or if you just want some company
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to
Honey come and see about me
You been hurt so many times
And I know what youre thinking of
Well I dont have to be no doctor babe
To see that youre madly in love
Sad Im asittin on the railroad track
Watching that old smokestack
Train is aleavin but it wont be back
Years ago we hang around
Watching trains roll through the town
Now that train is agraveyard bound
Where we go up in that North Country
Lakes and streams and mines so free
I had no better friend than he
Something happened to him that day
I thought I heard a stranger say
I hung my head and stole away
A diesel truck was headin down
Carryin' up a heavy load
Left him on a Utah road
They carried him back to his hometown
His mother cried his sister moaned
Listening to them church bells tone
A diesel truck was rollin' slow
Pullin' down a heavy load
It left him on a Utah road
II sung the last verse for ya because I missed the words the first time I sung them about the truck
I once loved a girl her skin it was bronze
With the innocence of a lamb she was gentle like a fawn
I courted her proudly but now she is gone
Gone as the season she's taken
In a young summer's youth I stole her away
From her mother and sister though close did they stay
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us
Of the two sisters I loved the young
With sensitive instincts she was the creative one
Their constant scrapegoat she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her
For her parasite sister I had no respect
Bound by her boredom her pride to protect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society
Myself for what I did I cannot be excused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The couldbe dreamlover of my lifetime
With unseen consciousness I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece though its heart being chipped
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To the sin of love's false security
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
Answers of emptiness voice vacancies
'Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please
What's wrong what's exactly the matter
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
At the peak of the night the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces
The tragic figure her sister did shout
Leave her alone God damn you get out
And I in my armor turning about
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
And she in between the victim of sound
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows
All is gone all is gone admit it take flight
I gagged in contradiction tears blinding my sight
My mind it was mangled I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me
The wind knocks my window the room it is wet
The words to say I'm sorry I haven't found yet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is
Ah my friends from the prison they ask unto me
How good how good does it feel to be free
And I answer them most mysteriously
Are birds free from the chains of the skyway
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you you say Who is that man
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home
You raise up your head
And you ask Is this where it is
And somebody points to you and says
It's his
And you say What's mine
And somebody else says Well what is
And you say Oh my God am I here all alone
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says How does it feel to
Be such a freak
And you say Impossible
As he hands you a bone
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To taxdeductible charity organization
Aw you've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F Scott Fitzgerald's books
You are very well read
It's well known
Well the sword swallower he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan
Now you see this oneeyed midget
Shouting the word Now
And you say For what reason
And he says How
And you say What does this mean
And he screams back You're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home
Well you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There oughtta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin broken down
He looked for work and money
And he walked a ragged mile
He looked for work and money
And ya' walked a ragged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they dont know how to smile
Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre atugging at your sleeve
Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre atugging at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If theres anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares
He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell ya'
That you aint agot no friend
Your babies are crying louder now
Its apoundin' on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
Its apoundin' on your brain
Your wifes screams are stabbin' ya'
Like the dirty drivin' rain
Your grass is turnin' black
Theres no water in your well
Your grass is turnin' black
Theres no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
Thats hanging on the wall
Your brain is ableedin'
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your brain is ableedin'
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That youre holding in your hand
Theres seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Theres seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the oceans poundin' roar
Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewheres in the distance
Theres seven new people born
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view
The fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron
Where beauty and pleasure were known
I spied a fair maid at her labour
Which caused me to stay for a while
And I thought of a goddess to beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle
I humbled myself to her beauty
Fair maiden where do you belong
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne
Young man I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more than my heart can endure
Therefore I remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle
Young maiden I wish not to banter
It's true I come here in disguise
I came here to fulfill our last promise
And hope to give you a surprise
I've known you're a maid I love dearly
And you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsel
Than my blooming bright star of Belle Isle
Oh well I love ya pretty baby
You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne
Well I'm moving after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I'd do without it
Without this love that we call ours
Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
We'll keep on loving pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Well my ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head
I woke in the mornin' wandering
Weary and worn out
I woke in the morning wandering
Weary and worn out
Wishin my longlost lover
Would walk to me and talk to me
Tell me what its all about
I was standin at the side road
Listenin to the billboard knock
Standin' at the side road
Listenin to the billboard knock
Well my wrist was empty
But my nerves were kickin
Tickin like a clock
Well I got anything you need babe
Let me tell you in front
If I got anything you need babe
Let me tell you in front
You can come to me sometime
Night time day time
Any time you want
Sometimes Im thinkin' Im
Too high to fall
Sometimes Im thinkin' Im
Much too high to fall
Other times Im thinkin' Im
So low I dont know
If I can come up at all
Black crows in the meadow
Sleepin' across a broad highway
Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway
Though its funny honey
I'm outta' touch dont feel much like a
Scarecrow today
Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
She smiles walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay
As the morning light breaks open the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
Pardon monsieur the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
Am I hearing you right
And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinking hes the Soviet Ambassador
She starts to speak but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes the lights blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
Can you see anything
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says Open up another deck
But the dealer says Attendezvous sil vous plait
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the womans hand
Said Heres a ring it cost a grand
She said That ain't enough
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horsedrawn taxi waited at the curb
She passed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read Do Not Disturb
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay
Ive got to talk to someone quick
But the Greek said Go away and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried Help theres danger near
Please open up the door
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love
But the desk clerk said It happens every day
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay
As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
The dealer said Its too late now
You can take your money but I dont know how
Youll spend it in the tomb
The tiny man bit the soldiers ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
While shes out on the balcony where a stranger tells her
My darling je vous aime beaucoup
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay
I was sitting home alone one night in LA
Watching old Cronkite on the seven oclock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes
Didnt seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
Theres another hardluck story that youre going to hear
And theres really nothing anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay
Seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Well I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes amoaning
Hear that undertakers bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Theres a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
Hes dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
Theres a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Well God is in His heaven
And we all want whats His
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
Im gazing out the window
Of the St James Hotel
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Woke up this morning feeling blue
Seen a goodlooking girl can I make love with you
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you babe
I don't care what in the world you do
I went back home put on my tie
Going to get that girl that money that money will buy
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you babe
I don't care what in the world you do
She looked at me begin to smile
Said Hey hey man can't you wait a little while
No no babe I got blood in my eyes for you
No no babe I got blood in my eyes for you
Got blood in my eyes for you babe
I don't care what in the world you do

I don't care what in the world you do

And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper Please adore me
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold
Blue moon now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Bobby's in the basement making his movie
He paints a little picture but not to be cheesy
He wants this little girl to believe in him easy
Bristles to the canvas imagining he feels high mmm
Inspiration of my heart search for light out of the dark
All the pictures in my heart lie awake there in my fog
This oasis in my arms I approach it with disarm
Though it might do me some harm stop to catch me if I fall
Bobby's in the basement making his music
He never won't stop though not to abuse it
If there's some other way that they only would use it
He lives another day but they always refuse it
Lacerations of my heart
Dropped down in pieces in the dark
Mixed the words up on this page
Makes the purple turn to beige
Inspiration of my heart search for light out of the dark
All the pictures in my heart lie awake there in my fog
This oasis in my arms I approach it with disarm
Though it might do me some harm
So stop to catch me if I fall
Well the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are riding down the line
Fixing everybodys troubles
Everybodys except mine
Somebody must have told them
That I was doing fine
Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothing in your heads
I got a real gal Im loving
And Lord Ill love her till Im dead
Go away from my door and my window too
Right now
Lord I am not going down to no race track
See no sports car run
I dont have no sports car
And I dont even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block
Well the wind keeps ablowing me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you dont step on me
Well look it here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your sixshooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right
Yes
Oh I'm sailin' away my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the morning
Is there somethin' I can send you I'm across the sea
From the place that I'll be landing
No there's nothin' you can send me my own true love
There's nothin' that I'm wishing to be ownin'
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean
Ah but I just thought you might want somethin' fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
Well if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
Id forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'
Well I might be gone a long old time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there somethin' I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passing
How can how can you ask me again
When it only brings me sorrow
'Cause the same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow
I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship sailin'
Sayin' I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm feelin'
If you my love must think that way
I'm sure your mind is roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're goin'
So take heed take heed of the western winds
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes there's somethin' you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather
Feel like a brokedown engine ain't got no drivin' wheel
Feel like a brokedown engine ain't got no drivin' wheel
You all been down and lonesome you know just how a poor man feels
Been shooting craps and gambling momma and I done got broke
Been shooting craps and gambling momma and I done got broke
I done pawned my pistol baby my best clothes been sold
I went down in my praying ground fell on my bended knees
I went down in my praying ground fell on my bended knees
I ain't cryin' for no religion Lord give me back my good gal please
If you give me back my baby I won't worry you no more
Give me back my baby I won't worry you no more
Don't have to put her in my house Lordy just lead her to my door
Can't you hear me baby rappin' on your door
Can't you hear me baby rappin' on your door
Now you hear me tappin' tappin' across your floor
Feel like a brokedown engine ain't got no drive at all
Feel like a brokedown engine ain't got no drive at all
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl
Feel like a brokedown engine ain't got no whistle or bell
Feel like a brokedown engine ain't got no whistle or bell
If you're a real hot momma come take away Daddy's weeping spell
Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love honey baby
I can stand

And hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive friends will disappear
If you want me honey baby
Ill be here
I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me
Misery
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I aint no monkey but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
Im taking you with me honey baby
When I go
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must
You do what you must do and you do it well
Ill do it for you honey baby
Cant you tell
Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love honey baby
I can stand
I been meek
And hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive friends will disappear
If you want me honey baby
Ill be here
I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me
Misery
Little red wagon
Little red bike

You do what you must do and you do it well
Ill do it for you honey baby

Well I walked all night long
Hearin' them church bells tone
Yes I walked all night long
Listen to them church bells tone
Either someone needing mercy
Or might be somethin' I've done wrong
Well your friends come by for you
I don't know what to say
Well your friends come by for you
I don't know what to say
I just can't face to tell 'em
Honey you just went away
The children cry for mother
I tell 'em Mother took a trip
Well the children cry for mother
I tell 'em Mother took a trip
Well I walk on pins and needles
I hope my tongue don't slip
Well I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
Yes I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
But the sun goes around the heavens
And another day just drives on through
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
Way out in the distance
I know you're with some other man
But that's alright baby
You know I always understand
Call girls in the doorway
All givin' me the eye
Call girls in the doorway
All givin' me the eye
But my heart's just not in it
I might as well pass right on by
My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
My ears are ringin'
Ringin' like empty shells
Well it can't be no guitar player
It must be combat bells
Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay will it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling so it goes some things were meant to be
Take my hand take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
I cant wait wait for you to change your mind
Its late Im trying to walk the line
Well its way past midnight and there are people all around
Some on their way up some on their way down
The air burns and Im trying to think straight
And I dont know how much longer I can wait
Im your man Im trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand that my heart cant go on beating without you
Well your loveliness has wounded me Im reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
Im breathing hard standing at the gate
But I dont know how much longer I can wait
Skies are grey Im looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day it doesnt matter where I go anymore I just go
If I ever saw you coming I dont know what I would do
Id like to think I could control myself but it isnt true
Thats how it is when things disintegrate
And I dont know how much longer I can wait
Its mighty funny the end of time has just begun
Oh honey after all these years youre still the one
While Im strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
But I dont know how much longer I can wait
Lazy stadium night
Catfish on the mound
Strike three the umpire said
Batter have to go back and sit down
Used to work on Mr Finleys farm
But the old man wouldnt pay
So he packed his glove and took his arm
And one day he just ran away
Come up where the Yankees are
Dress up in a pinstripe suit
Smoke a custommade cigar
Wear an alligator boot
Carolina born and bred
Love to hunt the little quail
Got a hundredacre spread
Got some huntin dogs for sale
Reggie Jackson at the plate
Seeing nothing but the curve
Swing too early or too late
Got to eat what Catfish serve
The cats in the well the gentle lady is asleep
Cats in the well the gentle lady is asleep
She aint hearing a thing the silence is astickin her deep
The cats in the well and grief is showing its face
The worlds being slaughtered and its such a bloody disgrace
The cats in the well the horse is going bumpety bump
The cats in the well and the horse is going bumpety bump
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump
The cats in the well and Papa is reading the news
His hairs falling out and all of his daughters need shoes
The cats in the well and the barn is full of bull
The cats in the well and the barn is full of bull
The night is so long and the table is oh so full
The cats in the well and the servant is at the door
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war
Im beginning to hear voices and theres no one around
Well Im all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
My love for her is taking such a long time to die
Im waist deep waist deep in the mist
Its almost like almost like I dont exist
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
The walls of pride are high and wide
Cant see over to the other side
Its such a sad thing to see beauty decay
Its sadder still to feel your heart torn away
One look at you and Im out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Theres too many people too many to recall
I thought some of m were friends of mine I was wrong about m all
Well the road is rocky and the hillsides mud
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
I found my world found my world in you
But your love just hasnt proved true
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Oh the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
Reality has always had too many heads
Some things last longer than you think they will
There are some kind of things you can never kill
Its you and you only I been thinking about
But you cant see in and its hard lookin out
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Well the fats in the fire and the waters in the tank
The whiskeys in the jar and the moneys in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
Im gonna remember forever the joy that we shared
Looking at you and Im on my bended knee
You have no idea what you do to me
Im twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
This morning I looked out my window and found
A bluebird singing but there was no one around
At night I lay alone in my bed
With an image of you goin' around in my head
I guess I must have loved you more than I ever knew
My world is empty now 'cause it don't have you
And if I had just one more chance to win your heart again
I would do things differently but what's the use to pretend
My little brother's in the other room that's why my house a mess
I'm a victim to these afterthoughts yes I'm sure you could guess why
Yes I'm sure you could guess why why
The sink is full of dishes Pizza Pockets in a pan
But I guess if you get hungry I can heat them up again if you like
If you like how's your night Watch your step over that box it's my bad
My little brother is a handful oh man oh man
Or do you like to play funny games I got Scrabble or Candyland
I'm a handyman my candy band spinning Beatles
I'm a Abbey fan on the needles I'm spinning records for you
I'm spinning records for two
Made it through the gumdrop mountain octopus' garden playing Oh Darling
Here comes the sun that rainbow pass is only saying the end
Sun king to king candy let's pretend let's pretend
My little brother's in the other room that's why my house a mess
I'm a victim to these afterthoughts yes I'm sure you could guess why
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they passtheyslip away acrossthe universe
Pools of sorrow waves ofjoy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
I read the news todayoh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

Can I bring my friend to tea
E F G H I J I love you
Black white green red
Can I take my friend to bed
Pink brown yellow orange and blue I love you
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be It's easy
If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad just call me tonight
If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There's nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight and I'll come to you
Well if your hands start aclapping
And your fingers start apopping
And your feet start amoving around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round
I love you 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true thatitreally only goesto show
That I know that III I
Should never never never be blue
Now you're mine my happiness still makes me cry
And in time you'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had
I love you 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that II I I
Should never never never be blue
I dream of your first kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still though we're far apart
A taste of honey A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
She thinksof him and so she dressesin black
And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black
I think of her but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim she thinks of him
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back she's dressed in black

For the benefit of Mr Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In his way Mr K will challenge the world
The celebrated Mr K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr H will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr Kite is topping the bill

The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark

Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law nigga grippin' my balls
Said the ladies they love me from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin' they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom to the top of the pops
Nigga London Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back get it Man I'm straight off the block
I can run it back nigga cause I'm straight with the Roc
Your homie Hov' in position in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca like a wrestler yessir
Keep the Heckler close you know them smokers'll test ya
But like  cards went out I'm through dealin'
Now  bars come out now you feel 'em
Now  cars roll out remove ceilin'
In case  broads come out now you chillin'
With a boss bitch of course SC on the sleeve
At the  club ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels I'm a grownup for real
Your boy back in the building Brooklyn we back on the map
Me and my beautiful beeitch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album then I back out it
As the best rapper alive nigga ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay for sellin' out the Garden in a day

You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are
Now lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more
I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you
Listen

Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby can't you see
I wanna be famous a star on the screen
But you can do something in between
I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time
I told that girl I can start right away
When she said listen babe I got something to say
I got no car and it's breakin' my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby can't you see
I wanna befamousa star onthe screen
But you can do somethingin between
Look what you're doing I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me
You got me running and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me
Ooh I need your love babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you
Love you everyday girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time
Ooh I need your love babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you
Love you everyday girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say girl
Love you all the time

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ooh ooh ah ah
Hey hey hey hey
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh ooh ooh ah ah
I'm filling thecracks that ran through the door
Andkept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ah
Hey hey hey hey
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh ah
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where itwillgo
I'm filling thecracks that ran through the door
Andkept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm painting a room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ooh ooh aah aah
Hey hey hey
Hey
I'm taking the time for a number of things

Your day breaks your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
You want her you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
You stay home she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone she doesn't need him
Your day breaks your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo

I used to get mad at my school No I can't complain
The teachers who taught me weren't cool No I can't complain
You're holding me down Ahah turning me 'round Ahoh
Filling me up with your rules Fool you fool
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can Fool you fool
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay
She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure
Will she still believe it when he's dead
I have no doubt about it
This must be love
One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Ooh baby hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Yeah the goose pimples baby
Because I feel so good
When you call me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Ooh mercy I'm rock gone puppy
And I'm happy
And I'm glad all over
Your touch sewed me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It don't take much looking
To see what I've got
But it shows yes it shows
Come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooh baby hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Yeah
Tried to tell you
How I'm cooking inside
When we're cheek to cheek
My temperature is low
Fever is high
I can't speak
I'm too weak
Well come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooh baby hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Well hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over

You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows

You know that we're as close as can be man

I tell you man he living there still
Well here's another place you can be
