Should I fall out of love my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin
The cup is raised the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word my will to sustain
For me the cloth once more to spin
Yours is the cloth mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind
There was a time I used to call you on my very own
We were so happy woman Talking for hours and hours on the telephone
Then one day I set you up to walk right out of my life
Leaving me all by myself All alone to cry every night
Now listen to me I said I made up my mind
Woman when you left me there oh
I was going to find another sweet lover
Who is going to feel all of my cares
So I met a sweet little girl Just about as nice as she could be oh
I fell in love with that woman But she turned around
And did the same thing again to me
So I made up my mind I going to crawl right back to you woman
I am going to plead and plead and plead yeah  Till you are here by my side
I cannot even walk down the same old streets we used to walk down
Because I keep thinking about all the good times
Keep thinking about it I want to make you mine

Her face is cracked from smiling
All the fears that she s been hiding
And it seems pretty soon everybody s gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting
Cheering winners who are losing
And she worries if their days are few
And soon they ll have to go
She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
Then she wonders what it s all about
When they break down the door
Her name is Brown or White or Black
You know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy
As the winners toll the bell
There is a train that leaves the station
Heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere
Has increased a dollar more Yes it has
And if you walk you re gonna get there
Though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan oh yeah

Jimmy Page electric guitar
Oh let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I amatraveler of bothtime and space
To be where Ihave been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh oh
Oh oh
Ooh baby I been flying
No yeah mama there ain t no denying
Oh oooh  yeah I ve been flying
Mama mama ain t no denying no denying
All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find trying to find where I ve been
Oh pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My ShangriLa beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin  through Kashmir
Oh father of the four winds fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh when I m on when I m on my way yeah
When I see when I see the way you stayyeah
Ooh yeahyeah ooh yeahyeah when I m down yeah
Ooh yeahyeah oh yeahyeah but I m down so down

Oh baby
Well there s a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can t wait for the night
I hate to think I ve been blinded baby
Why can t I see you tonight
And the warmth of your smile starts aburning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And I m shaking so much really yearning
Why don t you show up make it all right
Yeah it s all right
And if you promised you d love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me baby
What ever happened to you
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true
It aint the first time believe me baby
I m standing here feeling blue
Yeah I m blue
Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I ll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I m turning around
The clock on the wall s moving slower
My heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh that I found
Now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I ve got no reason to doubt you baby
It s all a terrible mess
And I ll run in the rain till I m breathless
When I m breathless I ll run till I drop hey
The thoughts of a fool s kind of careless
I m just a fool waiting on the wrong block oh yeah
You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around
And she said don t you want it
Don t you want cocaine cocaine cocaine
Hadn t planned to could not stand to
Try it fry it na na na na yeah
Heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned
Oh oh babe damned
Down in the pits you go no lower
The next stop s underground
Oh hello underground
Wine and roses ain t quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said didn t mean to
Did not mean to ffail
You didn t plan it you overran it
You want do it you want to
You want do it when you want to
You want do it do it when you want to
When you blow it babe
You got to blow it right
Oh baby if you fake it mama
Baby fake with all your might
When you fake it mama
Please fake it right for yourself babe
When you fake it baby
You re faking it for your life for your life
For your life for your life
Do it do it do it do it do it
Do it when you wanna
Do it do it do it do it do it
Do it when you wanna
Oh I can have you baby
But I don t know what to do yeah
Sometime baby nothing I could do
On the balance of a crystal
Paying through the nose
And when they couldn t resist you
I thought you d go with the flow
And now your stage is empty
Bring down the curtain baby please
Fold up your show
Hadn t planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn t planned it
I overran it frying
For your life for your life
She s a very kinky girl
The kind you don t take home to mother

She likes the boys in the band
She says that I m her alltime favorite
When I make my move to her room it s the right time
She s never hard to please oh no
She s a very special girl The kind of girl you want to know
From her head down to her toenails Down to her feet yeah
And she ll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends Girlfriends
In a limousine Going back in Chinatown
Three s not a crowd to her she says Menage
Room  I ll be waiting a trois
When I get there she s got incense wine and candles menage
It s such a freaky scene a trois
Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can t stop keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend she once told me
You got love you ain t lonely
Now she s gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew
Met a man on the roadside crying
Without a friend there s no denying
You re incomplete they ll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don t let them down although it grieves you
Some day you ll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew
Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can t stop keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend she once told me

Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don t let them down although it grieves you
Some day you ll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there s a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let  em tell you that they re all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake watch out
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
I ll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin  to find a woman who s never never never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it s not as hard hard hard as it seems
In the days of my youth I was told what it means to be aman
Andnow I ve reachedthat age I ve tried to doall those things the best I can
No matter how ItryIfind my wayinto the sameold jam
Sixteen I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days  til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear I lost another friend oh
Hey fellas have you heard the news
You know that Annie s back in town
It won t take long just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down
Her style is new but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes a different smile
Like that of one who knows
Well it s been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I ll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above
People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don t care what the people say
I know where their jive is at
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify please do
It s the way you call me by another guy s name
When I try to make love to you yeah
I try to make love but it ain t no use
Give it to me give it
Work so hard I couldn t unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried
Want to tell you about the girl I love
My she looks so fine
She s the only one that I been dreaming of
Maybe someday she will be all mine
I want to tell her that I love her so
I thrill with her every touch
I need to tell her she s the only one I really love
On Sunday morning when we go down to church
See the menfolk standing in line
Say they come to pray to the Lord
When my little girl looks so fine
In the evening when the sun is sinking low
Everybody s with the one they love
I walk the town
Keep asearching all around
Looking for my street corner girl
In the bars with the men who play guitars
Singing drinking and remembering the times
My little lover does a midnight shift
She followed around all of the time
I guess there s just one thing aleft for me to do
Going to pack my bags and move on my way
 Cause I got a worried mind
Sharing what I thought was mine
Going to leave her where the guitars play
Well I just got into town today
To find my girl who s gone away
She took the Greyhound at the General Store
I searched myself I searched the town
When I finally did sit down
I find myself no wiser than before
She said we couldn t do no wrong
No other love could be so strong
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
Now she took my heart she took my keys
From in my old blue dungarees
And I ll never go to Texas anymore
I took her love at seventeen
A little late these days it seems
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for
I took her word I took it all
Beneath the sign that said UHaul
She left angels hanging round for more
I thought I had it all sewn up
Our love a plot a pickup truck
But folks said she was after something more
I never did quite understand
All that talk about rocking bands
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
Oh yeah they just rolled my doll right out the door
Why well they just rolled my doll right out the door
From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan s daughter
And it only goes to show
There s an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I ll sow
So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you stall
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master s call
Oh Satan and man
Said there ain t no use in crying
Cause it will only only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying
Was this the only world you had Oh oh
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do
When I give you all my love
Please please be true
I ll give you all I ve got to give rings pearls and all
I ll give you all I ve got to give rings pearls and all
I ve got to get you together baby
I m sure sure you re gonna call
Oh when s the last time I done asked you
Well they call me the hunter
That s my name
They call me the hunter
That s how I got my fame
Ain t no need to hide
Ain t no need to run
 Cause I ve got you in the sights of my gun
How many more times barrel house all night long alright
How many more times barrel house all night long
Well I ve got to get to you baby
So please come home
Oh I can t quit you babe
So I m gonna put you down for awhile
I said I can t quit you babe
I guess I m gonna have to put you down for awhile
Said you messed up my happy home
Made me mistreat my only child
Said you know I love you baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh you know I love you baby
My love for you I could never hide
Oh when I feel you near me little girl
I know you are my one desire yeah
When you hear me moaning and groaning baby
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh when you hear me moaning and groaning babe
You know it hurts me deep down inside
Oh when you hear me holler baby
You know you re my one desire
Yes you are
Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark rutted cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction feel  burn
Still life incarnation
Still life infamy
Hallucination heresy
Still you run what s to come what s to be
The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide you hide but will be found
Release your grip without a sound
Still life immolation
Still life infamy
Hallucination heresy
Still you run what s to come What s to be
My mother was a witch she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch for the tears I cried
Take her down now don t want to see her face
All blistered and burnt can t hide my disgrace
As I watched my mother die I lost my head
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread
Taking no chances you come with me
I ll split you to the bone help set you free

Halls of justice painted green money talking
Power wolves beset your door hear them stalking
Soon you ll please their appetite they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you overpower
Apathy their stepping stone so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds
Lady justice has been raped truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips now you re done in
Their money tips her scales again make your deal
Just what is truth I cannot tell cannot feel
Halls of justice painted green money talking
Power wolves beset your door hear them stalking

Just what is truth I cannot tell cannot feel
Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity
Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose feign perception
Grudges break your back
Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become
Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish  em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on
Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone thy fears shall humble
Swallow all your pride
Yeah
Come clean confess up
Tell all spill gut
Off the veil stand revealed
Show the cards
Bring it on
Break the seal
Ladies and Gentleman step right up and
See the man who told the truth
Let on load off
Confess cast off
At the mercy the cat is out
Drop the disguise
Spit it up
Spit it out
And now what you ve all been waiting for
I give you He Who Suffers The Truth
Let us have peace let us have life
Let us escape the cruel night
Let us have time let the sun shine
Let us beware the deadly sign
Save us from fate save us from hate
Save ourselves before it s too late
Come to our need hear our plea
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds
Burp
HAH HAH HAH

You rise you fall youre down and you rise again
What don t kill you make you more strong
You rise you fall youre down and you rise again
What don t kill you make you more strong
Rise fall down rise again
What don t kill you make you more strong
Rise fall down rise again
What don t kill you make you more strong
Through black days through black nights
Through pitch black insides
The dawn the death the fight to the final breath

The dawn the death the fight to the final breath
What don t kill you make you more strong
Dawn death fight final breath
What don t kill you make you more strong

They scratch me they scrape me
They cut and rape me
Wake to face the day
Grab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patchandbattle on
Make itgo away
Please make it go away
Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don t fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away
Slaves Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word
Live in fear
Faith of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait something must be done
Four hundred years
Now let my people go
Land of Goshen
Go I will be with thee
Bush of fire
Blood running red and strong
Down the Nile
Plague darkness three days long
Hail to fire
I rule the midnight air
The destroyer
Born I shall soon be there
Deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor
Final darkness
Blood lambs blood painted door
I shall pass
Hey babe don t act so scared
All I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation
And I can tell by his face
I am a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case
Hey baby wait a minute stop
Don t run away don t call a cop
I am not looking to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you
I can tell by your face
I am all over this place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case no time baby
Hey babe don t turn away
I am here tomorrow gone today
I don t know what you think your game is
I don t care if you want your name is
And I can tell by this face
You are all over the place
I can tell by his face
Move over for a damage case
Get the fuck over man
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one s going to give in
Living on your knees conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred our bodies work as one
Bloody but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Slamming through don t fuck with razorback
Stepping out You ll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life isn t for you and we re the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it but it s no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All s fair for Damage Inc you see
Step a little closer if you please
Bodies fill the fields I see hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be a servant  til I fall
Barking of machinegun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks get used to it somehow
More a man more stripes you wear glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see the slaughter never ends
Life planned out before my birth nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself molded day by day
Looking back I realize nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend alone I clench my gun
Liberty or Death
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her
Rattling of her tail
Never begins it
Never but once engaged
Never surrenders
Showing the fangs of rage
I said Don t tread on me
Love it or leave it
She with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue
Forked as a lightning strike
Shining with brightness
Always on surveillance
The eyes they never close
Emblem of vigilance
Ooh no no no
Said Don t tread on me
Liberty or Death
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her
Rattling of her tail
He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath
He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving Earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive
He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes
Say your prayers little one
Don t forget my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in warm within
Keepyoufree from sin
 Tilthe sandman he comes
Sleep with oneeye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Say your prayers little one don t forget my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in warmwithinkeep you freefrom sin
 Til the Sandman he comes
Something swrong shut thelight heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren t of Snow White
Dreams of war dreams of liars dreams of dragons  fire
And of things that will bite yeah
Feel no pain but my life ain t easy
I know I m my best friend
No one cares but I m so much stronger
I ll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can t get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don t tell me what to do
I don t care now  cause I m on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain t right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
Life it seems will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters no oneelse
Ihave lost thewill to live
Simply nothing more togive
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss this can t be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he s gone
Life it seems will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss this can t be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he s gone
Luck luck luck
Runs runs runs
Out out out
Crawling from the wreckage one more time
This map is teared can t read the signs
Boulevard is rusted hard to turn
On the path of destruction feel it burn
Luck luck luck
Runs runs runs
Out out out
In love with my struggle
And in love with my pain
Much needed to keep me down again
Don t allow myself to feel too good
Unworthy of me couldn t if I could
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun on they run through the endless grey
On they fight for they re right
Yes but who s to say
For a hill men would kill
Why They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It s the last time he will
Blackened roar massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be blinded eyes to see
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun ontheyrun through theendless grey
On they fight for they reright
Yes but who s to say
For a hill men would kill

On the day the wall came down
They threw the locks onto the ground
And with glasses high we raised a cry
For freedom had arrived
On the day the wall came down
The Ship of Fools had finally run aground
Promises lit up the night
Like paper doves in flight
Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbors turn away
And theres a change that even with regret
Cannot be undone
Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty of history in shades of grey
I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels likemorethan a lifetime
Feelslike more than a lifetime
Sometimes Iget tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of beinginhere
Isthis the waythat it s alwaysbeen
Could it ever have been different
Do you ever get tired of the waiting
Do you ever get tired of being in there
Don t worry nobody lives forever
Nobody lives forever
We don t need no education
We don t need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey
Teacher leave them kids alone
We don t need no education
We don t need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey
Teacher leave them kids alone
Daddy s flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me
Daddy what d ya leave behind for me
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
We don t need your adulation
We don t need your starry gaze
How the years have come between us
You should have seen them in the early days
Should have seen them in the early days
They don t need your reminiscing
They don t need your memories
They don t want to hear who s missing
You should have seen them when the boys were young
You should have seen them when the boys were young
We don t need no education
We don t need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave them kids alone
Hey Teacher Leave them kids alone
We don t need no education
We don t need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey Teacher Leave us kids alone
I don t need no arms around me
And I don t need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don t think I need anything at all
No don t think I ll need anything at all
A cloud of eiderdown
Draws around me
Softening the sound
When night comes down you lock the door
The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change the wind is warm
Now wakes the owl now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream the dream is gone
Green fields a cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn
And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down
Lime and limpid green
A second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn Oberon Miranda and Titania
Neptune Titan
Stars can frighten
Lime and limpid green the sounds surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green the sounds surrounds
The icy waters underground
Lime and limpid green a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating downthesound resounds
Around theicy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn OberonMiranda and Titania
Neptune Titan stars can frighten
Lime and limpid green a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn Oberon Miranda and Titania
Neptune Titan stars can frighten
Blinding signs flap
Flicker flicker flicker blam
Pow pow
Stairway scare Dan Dare whos there
Lime and limpid green the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground
Ive got a bike you can ride it if you like
Its got a basket a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
Id give it to you if I could but I borrowed it
Ive got a cloak its a bit of a joke
Theres a tear up the front
Its red and black Ive had it for months
If you think it could look good then I guess it should
I know a mouse and he hasnt got a house
I dont know why I call him Gerald
Hes getting rather old but hes a good mouse
Ive got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man there a man lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish Theyre on the dish
I know a room of musical tunes
Some rhyme some ching most of them are clockwork
Lets go into the other room and make them work
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more
The lunatic is in my head Hahahahahahaha
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade
You make the change
You rearrange me till I m sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
And there s someone in my head but it s not me
Breathe breathe in the air
Don t be afraid to care
Leave but don t leave me
Look around andchooseyour own ground
Run rabbit run
Dig that hole forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don t sit down it s time to dig another one
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all
All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one
Hello Hello hello hello

Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Drumming in the morning in the evening theyll be coming for you
Ten thousand men on the move
Ten thousand men on the move
None of them doing nothin that your mama wouldnt disapprove
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
All clean shaven all coming in from the cold
Hey Who could your lover be
Hey Who could your lover be
Let me eat off his head so you can really see
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Standing at my window wishing me Goodnight
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Each one of m got seven wives each one of m just out of jail
Ten thousand women all sweepin my room
Ten thousand women all sweepin my room
Spilling my buttermilk sweeping it up with a broom
How many paths did they try and fail
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail
How much poison did they inhale
How many black cats crossed their trail
Seven by seven they headed for heaven
Eight by eight they got to the gate
Nine by nine they drank the wine
Ten by ten they drank it again
How many tomorrows have they given away
How many compared to yesterday
How many more without any reward
How many more can they afford
Two by two they stepped into the ark
Two by two they step in the dark
Three by three theyre turning the key
Four by four they turn it some more
Well your railroad gate you know I just cant jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard you see
I just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight sweet Marie
Well I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes I waited for you when you hated me
Well I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yeah when you knew I had some other place to be
Now where are you tonight sweet Marie
Well six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
Alright so where are you tonight sweet Marie
Well I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard he follows me
Yes I can take him to your house but I cant unlock it
You see you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh where are you tonight sweet Marie
Well I been in jail when all the mail showed
That a man cant give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wondering where you are tonight sweet Marie
Oh where have you been my blueeyed son
And where have you been my darling young one
Ive stumbled down the side of twelve misty mountains
Ive walked and Ive crawled on six crooked highways
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
Oh what did you see my blueeyed son
And what did you see my darling young one
I saw a newborn baby with wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
And what did you hear my blueeyed son
And what did you hear my darling young one
I heard the sound of thunder that roared out a warning
I heard one person starve I heard many people laughing
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazing
And what will you do my blueeyed son
And what will you do my darling young one
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where hunger is ugly where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the colour and none is the number
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But Ill know my song well before I start singing
Oh where have you been my blueeyed son
And where have you been my darling youngone
Ivestumbled on theside of twelve misty mountains
Ive walkedand Ive crawled on six crooked highways
Ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
Oh what did you see my blueeyed son
And what did you see my darling young one
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers ableeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw tenthousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And what did you hear my blueeyed son
And what did you hear my darling young one
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazing
I heard tenthousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
Oh what did you meet my blueeyed son
And who did you meet my darling young one
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman her body was burning
I met a young girl she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
And what will you do now my blueeyed son
And what will you do now my darling young one
Im agoing back out fore the rain starts afalling
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioners face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color where none is the number
And Ill tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But Ill know my song well before I start singing
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I ll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you d only let your hair hang low
Alberta what s on your mind
Alberta what s on your mind
You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time
Alberta what s on your mind
Alberta don t you treat me unkind
Alberta don t you treat me unkind
Oh my heart is so sad
Cause I want you so bad
Alberta don t you treat me unkind
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I ll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you ll only let your hair hang low
There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There s too much confusion
I can t get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we ve been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There s too much confusion
I can t get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word
Hey
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But uh but you and I we ve been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin  falsely now
The hour s getting late
Hey
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well uh outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey
Yeah
I see jokers on my left thieves upon my right
Youd find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But Im still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black its too cold
Im all alone take me back to the roads
I had to roam to get here and Ill hitch back
Get a cab to my mothers house
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
Whats a brother for
When Im sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears full of war
I was a ploughman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs
Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an illmannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though
Thats why they live a lie
I dont think Ill ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a brothers at my side
Theres no trap door or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
Youve seen mine I think its time I see yours
I bet you that weve been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now Im trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics
Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I aint religious Im a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
Ive been a joker Ive been a thief Ive been a rapper
Ive been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter
I ain t lookin  to compete with you
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
Simplify you classify you

And I grab me a pint you know that Im a giant

Old man sailing in a dinghy boat

Now whos on the table whos to tell me
Oh yeah
Whos on the table whos to tell me
Oh yeah
Who should I tell oh who should I tell
The fortynine of you like bats out of hell
Oh underneath that old apple suckling tree
Are you ready to meet Jesus
Are you where you ought to be
Will He know you when He sees you
Or will He say Depart from Me
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren
And to take up my cross
Have I surrendered to the will of God
Or am I still acting like the boss
When destruction cometh swiftly
And theres no time to say a faretheewell
Have you decided whether you want to be
In heaven or in hell
Have you got some unfinished business
Is there something holding you back
Are you thinking for yourself
Or are you following the pack
As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paines
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains
I offered her my hand
She took me by the arm
I knew that very instant
She meant to do me harm
Depart from me this moment
I told her with my voice
Said she But I dont wish to
Said I But you have no choice
I beg you sir she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth
I will secretly accept you
And together well fly south
Just then Tom Paine himself
Came running from across the field
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield
And as she was letting go her grip
Up Tom Paine did run
Im sorry sir he said to me
Im sorry for what shes done
As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paines
I spied the fairestdamsel
Thatever did walkin chains
I offered her my hand
Shetook me by the arm
I knew that very instant
She meant to do me harm
Depart from me this moment
I told her with my voice
Said she But I dont wish to
Said I But you have no choice
I beg you sir she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth
I will secretly accept you
And together well fly south
Just then Tom Paine himself
Came running from across the field
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield
And as she was letting go her grip
Up Tom Paine did run
Im sorry sir he said to me
Im sorry for what shes done
I ve got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket s closed
Rap critics that say he s Money Cash Hoes
I m from the hood stupid What type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You d celebrate the minute you was havin  dough
I m like Fuck critics you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don t like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don t play they show
They don t play my hits well I don t give a shit so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give  em more cash for ads
Fuckers I don t know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I m from rags to riches niggas I ain t dumb
I got  problems but a bitch ain t one  hit me
The year is   in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin  law
Got two choices y all pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor
And I ain t tryin  to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard Son do you know why I m stopping you for
Cause I m young and I m black and my hat s real low
Do I look like a mind reader sir I don t know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more
Well you was doing  in a
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you I know a lot of you are
I ain t steppin  out of shit all my paper s legit
Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit
Well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights so you gon  need a warrant for that
Aren t you sharp as a tack
You some type of lawyer or something
Somebody important or something
Well I ain t passed the bar but I know a little bit
Enough that you won t illegally search my shit
Well we ll see how smart you are when the K come
I got  problems but a bitch ain t one hit me
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strongarm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin  a pussy
But a pussy havin  no goddamn sense try and push me
I try to ignore him talk to the Lord
Pray for him but some fools just love to perform
You know the type loud as a motorbike
But wouldn t bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that s gon  happen is I ma get to clappin
And he and his boys gonna be yappin  to the Captain
And there I go trapped in the KitKat again
Back through the system with the riffraff again
Fiends on the floor scratchin  again
Paparazzis with they cameras snappin  em
DA try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil  for bail cause I m African
All because this fool was harassin  them
Tryin  to play the boy like he s saccharine
But ain t nothin  sweet  bout how I hold my gun
I got  problems bein  a bitch ain t one hit me
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don t arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don t hear it
Does it mean you don t love me any more
I hear the clock a ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a moving
But I m by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I m by myself
I don t see you
Does it mean you don t love me any more
I m sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that s alright I m waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don t arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don t hear it
Does it mean you don t love me any more
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
I read the news todayoh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn t notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They d seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Well if your hands start aclapping
And your fingers start apopping
And your feet start amoving around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can t help it
And you can t sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round
I love you  cause you tell me things I want to know
And it s true that it really only goes to show
That I know that II I I
Should never never never be blue
Now you re mine my happiness still makes me cry
And in time you ll understand the reason why
If I cry it s not because I m sad
But you re the only love that I ve ever had
I love you  cause you tell me things I want to know
And it s true that it really only goes to show
That I know that II I I
Should never never never be blue
I dream of yourfirst kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still though we re far apart
That taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
It s not the way you smile that touched my heart
Sha la la la la
It s not the way you kiss that tears me apart
You should hear what they say about you cheat cheat
Sha la la la la
They say they say you never never never ever been true
Cheat cheat
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he ll never come back she s dressed in black
I think of her but she thinks only of him
And though it s only a whim she thinks of him
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he ll never come back she s dressed in black
She thinksof him and so she dressesin black
And though he ll never come back she s dressed in black
I think of her but she thinks only of him
And though it s only a whim she thinks of him
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he ll never come back she s dressed in black
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn t get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it s good to be back home
Leave it til  tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Oh show me round your snowpeaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy s farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

You used to be alright
What happened
Did the cat get your tongue
Did your string come undone
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It s as soft as your pillow
You used to be alright
What happened
Et cetera et cetera
Fads for whatever
Fifteen steps then a sheer drop
You used to be alright what happened
Did the cat get your tongue
Did your string come undone
One by one one by one
It comes to us all it s as soft as your pillow
You used to be alright what happened
Et cetera et cetera
Fads for whatever Yeah
Fifteen steps then a sheer drop
In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In a deep deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I m amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
I m the next act
Waiting in the wings
I m an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
That you choose to ignore
I m a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I m just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others
Destiny destiny protectme from the world
Destiny hold myhand protect me from the world
Grow my hair
Grow my hair I am Jim Morrison
If I grow my hair
So maybe I could become Jim Morrison
Fat ugly dead
I don t know why you bother
Nothing s ever good enough for you
I was there it wasn t like that
You ve come here just to start a fight
Hypocrite opportunist
Don t infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn  round you stay frozen to the spot
If I get old I will not give in
But if I do remind me of this
Remind me that once I was free
Once I was cool once I was me
And if I sit down and cross my arms
Hold me up to this song
If I get old remind me of this
The way that we kissed and I really meant it
Whatever happens if we re still speaking
Pick up the phone play me this song
Are you lonely
Are you living on the seat of your pants
Are you happy
Wipe that smile off your face
Are you someone
Lose my pinball eyes
Are you lonely
Are you broken all in a vice
Here s the detective
He s in charge of your case
Here s the detective
And he s hoping to waste my name
Are you crazy
Are you blessed in bed in his arm
Is there mumbling
Will you cry us a play in it
Are you happy
Your crossed legs
We re rotten fruit
We re damaged goods
What the hell we ve got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We re backdrifting
This far but no further
I m hanging off a branch
I m teetering on the brink of
Honey sweets so full of sleep
I m backsliding
All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you re backtracking
We re rotten fruit
We re damaged goods
What the hell we ve got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We re backdrifters
I m standing in the hall I m puking on the wall
It s all heading south to the Conger Hill
The bangers and the mash the negatives for cash
You re either in the club baby or you re not
Whatever turns you on whatever gets you up
Chief of police or vice chancellor
Lord and Lady blahblah the vicar and the judge
You re all dancing to my little red book
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power we re changing by the hour
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark the dark will stare back
Back into your soul
I m taking you down I m taking you down
I m taking you down when I go down
I m taking you down I m taking you down
I m standing in the hall I m puking on the wall
Dressed in bishop s robes
Terrifies me still in bishop s robes
Bastard headmaster
Children taught to kill
To tear themselves to bits on playing fields
Dressed in bishop s robes
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It s what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt
Don t blow your mind with whys
I m moving out of orbit Turning in somersaults
Turning in somersaults A giant turtle s eyes
A giant turtle s eyes As jellyfish float by
As jellyfish float by
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It s what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt
Don t blow your mind with whys
I m moving out of orbit Turning in somersaults
Turning in somersaults A giant turtle s eyes
A giant turtle s eyes As jellyfish float by
As jellyfish float by
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It s what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt
Don t blow your mind with whys
I m moving out of orbit Turning in somersaults
Turning in somersaults A giant turtle s eyes
A giant turtle s eyes As jellyfish float by
As jellyfish float by
In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel
I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack out
I don t want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders wrists knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
Now I can t climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac painkillers
When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer let it be
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on  til tomorrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom Let it be
Little darling it s been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling it feels like years since it s been here
Little darling the smile s returning to their faces
Little darling it seems like years since it s been here
Little darling I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling it seems like years since it s been clear

Fourthousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
There are places I ll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there s nobody there
What does he care
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
I look at you all see the love there that s sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I look at the world and I notice it s turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I look at you all see the love there that s sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It s getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn t matter much to me
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can t you know tune in but it s all right
That is I think it s not too bad
Always no sometimes think it s me
But you know I know when it s a dream
I think a no I mean a yes but it s all wrong
That is I think I disagree
What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me
Lend me your ears and I ll sing you a song
And I ll try not to sing out of key
What do I do when my love is away
Does it worry you to be alone
How do I feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because you re on your own
Would you believe in a love at first sight
Yes I m certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light
I can t tell you but I know it s mine
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody s help in any way
But now these days are gone I m not so self assured
Now I find I ve changed my mind and opened up the doors
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I ve never done before
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody s help in any way
But now these days are gone I m not so self assured
Now I find I ve changed my mind and opened up the doors
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us Everyone of us has all we need Has all we need
Sky of blue Sky of blue and sea of green Sea of green
In our yellow In our yellow submarine Submarine haha
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn t get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it s good to be back home
Leave it til  tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Oh show me round your snowpeaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy s farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn t like that
He said I m gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
And Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said Danny boy this is a showdown
But Daniel was hot he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said Rocky you met your match
And Rocky said Doc it s only a scratch
And I ll be better I ll be better Doc as soon as I am able
Oh Darling please believe me
I ll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I ll never do you no harm

No one you can save that can t be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It s easy
There s nothing you can know that isn t known
Nothing you can see that isn t shown
There s nowhere you can be that isn t where you re meant to be
It s easy

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear I ve seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Don t leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Don t keep me waiting here Don t keep me waiting
Lead me to your door
You think you ve lost your love
Well I saw her yesterday
It s you she s thinking of
And she told me what to say
She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she said she knows
You re not the hurting kind
You know it s up to you
I think it s only fair
Pride can hurt you too
Apologise to her
Id like to be under the sea
In an octopuss garden in the shade
Hed let us in knows where weve been
In his octopuss garden in the shade
Id ask my friends to come and see
An octopuss garden with me
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopuss garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we cant be found
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves Lies beneath the ocean waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe Happy and theyre safe
We would be so happy you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
Then there s this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They d get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It s all the same thing in this case manufactured by someone who s always
Umpteen time your father s giving it diddlyidee
District was leaving intended to pay for
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you re doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives
I ve missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with like wow
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody s shortcuts aha
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low
So the wife called me and we d better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So any road we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn t any good at all
So instead I d marry join the bloody navy and went to sea
Block that kick block that kick
In my broken chair my wings are broken and so is my hair
I m not in the mood for whirling
Um da
Aaah
How
Dogs for dogging hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
Only to find the nightwatchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
Onion soup
Maybe even then
Exposure could be difficult thing
It s quick like rush for peace is
Because it s so much
It was like being naked
If you become naked
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn t last
Jojo left his home in Tucson Arizona
For some California grass
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she s got it coming
But she gets it while she can
Ooo ow
Get back Loretta
Your mommy s waiting for you
Wearing her highheel shoes
And her lowneck sweater
Get back home Loretta
Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round
Ahh
Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
Ahh
Because the sky is blue it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue
It s been a hard day s night
And I ve been working like a dog
It s been a hard day s night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it s worth it just to hear you say
You re gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
 Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
It s been a hard day s night
And I ve been working like a dog
It s been a hard day s night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Ah
So why on earth should I moan
 Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
It s been a hard day s night
And I ve been working like a dog
It s been a hard day s night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do

Wednesday morning at five o clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that s lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband Daddy our baby s gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me
Friday morning at nine o clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
Turn off your mind relax and float downstream
It is not dying it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts surrender to the void
It is shining it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being it is being
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing it is knowing
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living it is not living
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down
I used to get mad at my school No I can t complain
The teachers who taught me weren t cool No I can t complain
You re holding me down Ahah turning me  round Ahoh
Filling me up with your rules Fool you fool
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word I finally heard
I m doing the best that I can
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I m changing my scene
And I m doing the best that I can Fool you fool
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No I never saw them at all
Till there was you
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Day after day alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him they can see that he s just a fool
And he never gives an answer
Well on the way head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
And nobody seems to like him they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
And he never listens to them he knows that they re the fools
They don t like him
Who knows how long I ve loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to I will
For if I ever saw you
I didn t catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh you know I will
I will
They say it s your birthday
Well it s my birthday too yeah
They say it s your birthday
We re gonna have a good time
I m glad it s your birthday
Happy birthday to you
They say it s your birthday
Well it s my birthday too yeah

Happy birthday to you

Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said You ve got to go back
You know they didn t even give us a chance
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
You can make it OK
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said Say what you doing in bed
I said We re only trying to get us some peace
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said She s gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said We wish you success
It s good to have the both of you back
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head I m still yawning
When I m in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float up stream Float up stream
Everybody seems to think I m lazy
I don t mind I think they re crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there s no need There s no need
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head I m still yawning
When I m in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed float up stream Float up stream

Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
Everywhere there s lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
Last night I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try girl
You don t need me to show the way love
Why do I always have to say love
Last night I said these words to my girl

Feeling twofoot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them seeing them
In the state I m in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way

Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

Would love to love you
And that she will cry

He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mum
He s the all American bulletheaded Saxon mother s son
All the children sing
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce his mummy butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing
I was alone I took a ride
I didn t know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh then I suddenly see you
Ooh did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
You didn t run you didn t lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time
We d meet again for I had told you
Ooh you were meant to be near me
Ooh and I want you to hear me
Say we ll be together every day
What can I do what can I be
When I m with you I want to stay there
If I m true I ll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh then I suddenly see you
Ooh did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Your voice is soothing but the words aren t clear

You re thinking of me the same old way
You were above me but not today

You don t look different but you have changed

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain

Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you re something special when you smile
Childlike
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don t know what it s like to listen to your fears
Big man Yeah
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven t got a clue
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around it s past
You don t get time to hang a sign on me
A lifetime is so short
A new one can t be bought
But what you ve got means such a lot to me
There s people standing round
Who ll screw you in the ground
They ll fill you in with all their sins you ll see
One day you ll look to see I ve gone
For tomorrow may rain so I ll follow the sun
Some day you ll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain so I ll follow the sun
One day you ll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain so I ll follow the sun
One day you ll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain so I ll follow the sun

I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps but they don t arrive
Waiting for your knock dear on my old front door
I don t hear itdoes it mean you don t love me any more
I hear the clock a ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a moving but I m by myself
I wonder where you are tonight and why I m by myself
I don t see you does it mean you don t love me any more
I m sorry that I doubted you I was so unfair
You were in a car crash and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late about an hour or two
I said that s alright I m waiting here just waiting to hear from you
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh my my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I m beside you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven t I the right to make it up girl
Treasure these few words  til we re together
Keep all my love forever

And  til the day I do love

My head is filled with things to say
When you re here
All those words they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It s all right
I ll make you maybe next time around
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don t know why
I don t mind
I could wait forever I ve got time
I want to tell you

You don t realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I m lonely as can be

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me
I didn t realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me

I could never really live without you
So come on back and see just what you mean to me I need you
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So come on back and see just what you mean to me I need you
I need you

Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry
What have I done to deserve such a fate
I realise I have left it too late
And so it s true pride comes before a fall
I m telling you so that you won t lose all
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn t you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light I saw the light
I know that you saw me
 Cause I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That s a lie
 Cause I know where you ve been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died I nearly died
 Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That s a lie
 Cause I know where you ve been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died I nearly died
 Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
It s not the way you smile that touched my heart
Sha la la la la
It s not the way you kiss that tears me apart
You should hear what they say about you cheat cheat
Sha la la la la
They say they say you never never never ever been true
Cheat cheat
My baby said she s travelling on the one after
I said move over honey I m travelling on that line

Say the word and you ll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I m thinking of
Have you heard the word is love
It s so fine It s sunshine
It s the word love
Spread the word and you ll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I m thinking of
Have you heard the word is love
It s so fine It s sunshine
It s the word love
Say the word and you ll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I m thinking of
Have you heard the word is love
It s so fine It s sunshine
It s the word love
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It s the word I m thinking of
And the only word is love
It s so fine It s sunshine
It s the word love
I want a love that s right
But right is only half of what s wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I d hate
I ll make an early start
I m making sure that I m not late hey
It s been a long time now I m coming back home
I ve been away now oh how I ve been alone
But if your heart breaks don t wait turn me away
And if your heart s strong hold on I won t delay
It s been a long time now I m coming back home
I ve been away now oh how I ve been alone
But if your heart breaks don t wait turn me away
And if your heart s strong hold on I won t delay
It s been a long time now I m coming back home
I ve been away now oh how I ve been alone
When I look into your eyes your love is there for me
And the more I go inside the more there is to see
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you d like to be
Sail me on a silver sun where I know that I m free
Show me that I m everywhere and get me home for tea
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like the FBI
And the CIA
And the BBC
BB King
And Doris Day
Matt Busby dig it dig it
Dig it dig it dig it
Well gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It s a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature s rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart s beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues Woo
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two Woo
Well early in the morning
I m agiving you the warning
Don t you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I ll play my fiddle
Ain t got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She s got a crazy partner
Oughta see  em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop
I ve got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin  sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man they were blowing like a hurricane
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They re drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
Don t care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It s way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
They re gonna put me in the movies
They re gonna make a big star out of me
We ll make a film about a man that s sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I hope you ll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We ll make the scene about a man that s sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I ll play the part and I won t need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally
Well I hope you ll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
I been told when a boy kiss a girl

Money don t get everything it s true
What it don t get I can t use
Money don t get everything it s true

If you ll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
 Cause I really can t stand it I m so in love with you
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he ll never come back she s dressed in black
I think of her but she thinks only of him
And though it s only a whim she thinks of him
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he ll never come back she s dressed in black
I ll take my chances for romance is
So important to me
She ll never hurt me she won t desert me

Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She ll never hurt me she won t desert me
Listen can t you see
Don t take chances if your romance is
So important to you
She ll never hurt me she won t desert me
She s an angel sent to me

The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows

She looks as an African Queen
She eating twelve chapattis and cream
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
She coming from out of Bahran
She like to be married with Yetti
He grooving such cookie spaghetti
She jumping as Mexican bean
To make that her body morphine
She catch Patagonian pancake
With that one and gin party makes
She having always good contact
She making with Apple and contract
She looks as an African Queen
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
Sunrise doesn t last all morning
A cloudburst doesn t last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But it s not always going to be this grey
Sunset doesn t last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It has not always been this grey
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time
It s not always going to be this grey
You look tired love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold
Rest your head on my shoulder
And kiss me goodnight
We are together
Now and forever come my way
We re here to sing for you
And what if you want us to
We will sing a little song for you
You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder s never on your face
You re always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So please don t ever change
Now don t you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are
You don t know the latest dance
But when it s time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you re not a tomboy
So please don t ever change
Now don t you ever change
Just promise me you re always going to be
As sweet as you are
Now lots of other girls I ve seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So please don t ever change
Now don t you ever change
Just promise me you re always going to be
As sweet as you are
Well the stars always shine
You ll be mine and I know
You ll be mine
How they shine
You ll be mine
My darling
When you brought me that toast the other morning
I I looked into you eyes
And I could see that National Health eyeball
And I loved you like I ve never done
Like I ve never done before
How do you do what you do to me
I m feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven t a clue

Yeah
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I ve seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way
Many times I ve been alone
And many times I ve cried
Anyway you ve always known
The many ways I ve tried
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don t keep me standing here
Lead me to you door
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don t leave me standing here
Lead me to your door
I don t think it s funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you re standing there
Wearing diamond and rings Oh oh
You think I m soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It s not so funny
When you know what money can bring
I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn t notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They d seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I d love to turn you on
I read the news today oh boy
Fourthousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I d love to turn you on
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don t need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
WhenIfind myself intimes of trouble
Mother Mary comes tome
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
When all the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
But though they may be parted there is
Still a chance for that to see
There will be an answer let it be
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
You know you make me want to

Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Well Mama she done told me

That s alright that s alright my Mama anyway you do

This is the story
About a boy named Ted

Now Ted used to tell her

And he knew he could
Because in his head he said
Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
I just don t understand
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It s getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn t matter much to me
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can t you know tune in but it s all right
That is I think it s not too bad
Always no sometimes think it s me
But you know I know when it s a dream
I think er no I mean er yes but it s all wrong
That is I think I disagree
I look at you all see the love there that s sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don t know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don t know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it s turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don t know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don t know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at you all see the love there that s sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
Here come old flattop he come grooving up slowly
He got juju eyeballs he s one holy roller

He say I know you you know me

Standingin the dockat Southampton
Trying to get to Hollandor France
The man in the mac said You ve got to go back
You know they didn t even give us a chance
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
You can make it OK
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said Say what you doing in bed
I said We re only trying to get us some peace
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said She s gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said We wish you success
It s good to have the both of you back
When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words ofwisdomlet it be
Andin my hour of darkness sheis standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdomletitbe
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer let it be
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on  til tomorrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
But I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
This dog is going to get you
If you don t leave her alone
Well if your hands start aclapping
And your fingers start apopping
And your feet start amoving around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can t help it
And you can t sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round
Little darling it s been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling it seems like years since it s been here
Little darling the smile s returning to their faces
Little darling it feels like years since it s been here
Little darling I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling it seems like years since it s been clear
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it s evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don t you know that you can count me out in
You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We d all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We re doing what we can
But when you want money
For people with minds that hate
All I can tell is brother you have to wait
You say you ll change the constitution
Well you know
We d all love to change your head
You tell me it s the institution
Well you know
You better free you mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain t gonna make it with anyone anyhow

Long distance information

Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
Because my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall
Help me information
Get in touch with my Marie
She s the only one who d phone me here
From Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge
Help me information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis Tennessee
The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis Tennessee
Then there s this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They d get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It s all the same thing in this case manufactured by someone who s always
Umpteen your father s giving it diddlyidee
District was leaving intended to pay for
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you re doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives
I ve missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with like wow
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody s shortcuts aha
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low
Alright
So the wife called me and we d better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So any road we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn t any good at all
So I said I d marry join the bloody navy and went to sea
In my broken chair my wings are broken and so is my hair
I m not in the mood for whirling
Um da
Aaah
How
Dogs for dogging hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
Only to find the nightwatchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
Onion soup
Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
It s quick like rush for peace is
Because it s so much
It was like being naked
If you became naked
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia
Julia Julia ocean child calls me
So I sing a song of love Julia
Julia seashell eyes windy smile calls me
So I sing a song of love Julia
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering glimmering
In the sun

When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind Julia
Julia sleeping sand silent cloud touch me
So I sing a song of love Julia
Hum hum humcalls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia Julia Julia
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and turn
And I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again
Do you don t you want me to love you

Tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer

Tell me tell me tell me your answer
You may be a lover but you ain t no dancer
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls youyouanswer quite slowly
Agirl with kaleidoscope eyes
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up andwalkout on me
Lendme your ears and I ll singyou a song
And I ll try not to sing out of key
What do I do when my love is away
Does it worry you to be alone
How do I feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because you re on your own
Would you believe in a love at first sight
Yes I m certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light
I can t tell you but I know it s mine
I found it out what love is all about
And every day it sure lets out
I see my baby I get weak in the knees
 Cause nothin s shakin  but the leaves on the tree
My papi told me there d be times like these
There s nothin  shakin  but the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang and go to rockin  Joe s
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby tried to give her a squeeze
There s nothin  shakin  but the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be such a doggone tease
There s nothin  shakin  but the leaves on the trees
I m so tired I haven t slept a wink
I m so tired my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No no no
I m so tired I don t know what to do
I m so tired my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do
I m so tired I m feeling so upset
Although I m so tired I ll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Running to and fro hard
Working at the mail
Never fail
Get the mail
Yeah some rotten deal
Ow
Say me
Talking to me
Tryin  to run me up a creek
She used to buy one
Try to pay me again next week
Ow
Longhaired goodlooking
Trying to get me hooked
Or me to marry
Settle down
Get the horn by the bull
Ow
Mediocre money
Being fighting in the hall
Army bunk army go
Army chow army cook
Ow
Same thing every day
Getting up going to school
No need to make complaining
My objection s overruled
Ow
Working in the filling station
Too many tires
Wipe the windows
Check the tire
Check the oil and all the gas
Ow
Crying waiting hoping you ll come back
I just can t seem to get you off my mind
Crying waiting hoping you ll come back
You re the one I love I think about you all the time
There s nothing you can do that can t be done
Nothingyoucan sing thatcan t be sung
Nothing you can saybut you can learn how to play the game
It s easy
Nothing you can make that can t be made
No one you can save that can t be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It s easy
There s nothing you can know that isn t known
Nothing you can see that isn t shown
There s nowhere you can be that isn t where you re meant to be
It s easy
Who knows how long I ve loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime
If you want me to I will
For if I ever saw you
I didn t catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be to near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh you know I will I will
Dadada dada
Ladadada
Ladadadadadada
You know that it s true Rattle them skulls
Little darlingit sbeen a longcold lonely winter
Little darling it feelslike years since it s been here
Little darling the smile s returning to their faces
Little darling it seems like years since it s been here
Little darling I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling it seems like years since it s been clear

Well you should see Polythene Pam
She s so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
See Polythene Pam
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She s killerdiller when she s dressed to the hilt
Well it s a little absurd
But she s a nice class of bird
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Say she was attractively built
See Polythene Pam
She s so goodlooking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag News of the World
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
See Polythene Pam
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She s killerdiller when she s dressed to the hilt
She s the kind of a girl
That makes the News of the World
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She s killerdiller when she s dressed to the hilt
She s the kind of a girl it s a little absurd
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
His sister Shirley works in a shop
She never stops she s a gogetter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
It s the only place that he s ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper shoot
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose
Always no sometimes think it s me
But you know I know when it s a dream
I think I know I mean er yes but it s all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
There s never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood or this pop this hot or this strong
With so many different flows this one s for this song
The next one I switch up this one will get bit up
These fucks too lazy to make up shit they crazy
They don t paint pictures they just trace me
You know what Soon they forget where they plucked
Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
I m like TAA
I m not a biter I m a writer for myself and others
I say a BIG verse I m only biggin  up my brother
Biggin  up my borough I m big enough to do it
I m that thorough plus I know my own flow is foolish Whoo
So them rings and things you sing about bring  em out
It s hard to yell when the barrel s in your mouth
I m in new sneakers dualseaters few divas
What more can I tell you Let me spell it for you
WI doubleL IE
Nobody truer than HOV
And I m back for more New York s ambassador
Prime Minister back to finish my business up
You already know what I m about flyin  birds down South
Movin  wet off the step purple rain in a drought
Stuntin  on hoes brushin  off my shirt
But ain t nothin  on my clothes  cept my chain my name
Young HO pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol I make payroll
Benz paid for friends they roll
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos
Cris  caseloads I don t give a shit
Nigga one life to live I can t let a day go
By without me bein  fly fresh to death
Head to toe  til the day I rest
And I don t wear jerseys I m plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans nigga buttonups
S Dots on my feet make my cipher complete
What more can I say Guru play the beat
Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag
For like half a billy and your ass ain t lilyWhite
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly it s both
I don t mean to boast but damn if I don t brag
Them crackers gon  act like I ain t on they ass
The Martha Stewart that s far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student just had the balls to do it
And no I m not through with it
In fact I m just previewin  it
This ain t the show I m just EQin  it
Onetwo and I won t stop abusin  it
To groupie girls stop false accusin  it
Back to the music  the Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem Houston
What up B they can t shut up me
Shut down I not even PE I ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me
So picture me lettin  these clowns nitpick at me
Paint me like a pickany
I will literally kiss TiTi in the forehead
Tell her Please forgive me then squeeze into your forehead
I m not the one to score points off in fact
I got a joint that ll knock your points off
Young Hova the God nigga blast for me
I m at the Trump International ask for me
I ain t never scared I m everywhere you ain t never there
And nigga why would I ever care
Pound for pound I m the best to ever come around here
Excludin  nobody look what I embody
The soul of a hustler I really ran the street
A CEO s mind that marketin  plan was me
And no I ain t get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain t animated like say a Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat  a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
I m supposed to be number one on everybody list
We ll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this man

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn t last

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she s got it coming
But she gets it while she can
Nobodyeverloved me likeshe does

Andif somebody loved me like she do me
Oh she dome

And from the first time that she really done me
Oh she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh she done me
She done me good
If your life s not right doesn t satisfy you
Don t get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out find where you ve gone wrong
Better do it soon as you don t have long
If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there
Looking for release from limitation
There s nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There s only one way brings results
Well shake it up baby now shake it up baby
Twist and shout twist and shout
Cmon cmon cmon cmon baby now cmon baby
Cmon and work it on out work it on out

Well shake it up baby now shake it up baby

I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don t arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don t hear it
Does it mean you don t love me any more
I hear the clock a ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a moving
But I m by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I m by myself
I don t see you
Does it mean you don t love me any more
I m sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that s alright I m waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you
Let s all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long long time ago
Your mother should know Your mother should
Your mother should know know
Sing it again
Let s all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long long time ago
Your mother should know Your mother should
Your mother should know know
Let s all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long long time ago
Your mother should know Your mother should
Your mother should know
Let s all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long long time ago
Your mother should know Your mother should
Your mother should know
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long long time ago
Your mother should know Your mother should

Da da dada da da da dada dada dada da da

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending meavalentine
Birthday greetings bottleof wine
If I d been out tillquarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When I m sixtyfour
You ll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden digging the weeds
Who could ask for more
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When I m sixtyfour
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it s not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera Chuck and Dave
Send me a postcard drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me will you still feed me
When I m sixtyfour
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn t get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a awful flight
Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it s good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn t get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a awful flight
I ve been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it s good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when yourise
Sleepprettydarling do notcry
And I willsing a lullaby
I don t know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don t know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I don t know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don t know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
Ah because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round
Ah becausethewind is highit blows my mind
Because the windis high
Chorus
Ah love is old love is new
Love is all love is you
Because the sky is blue it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue
They say They never really miss you  til you dead or you gone
So on that note I m leavin  after the song
So you ain t gotta feel no way about Jay so long
At least let me tell you why I m this way hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC and my momma would claim
At  pounds when I was born I didn t give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn t purpose I ain t perfect I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn t matchin  my gear
Now I m just scratchin  the surface
 Cause what s buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school got good grades could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted hold on
Now all the teachers couldn t reach me
And my momma couldn t beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seein  me
So with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game fuck the world my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to  caine I m a hustler now
My gear is in and I m in the incrowd
And all the wavy lightskinned girls is lovin  me now
My selfesteem went through the roof man I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly knowin  nobody paid Jaz wackass
I m gettin  ahead of myself by the way I could rap
But that came second to me movin  this crack
Gimme a second I swear I would say about my rap career
Til   came niggas I m here goodbye
Goodbye to the game all the spoils the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot knowin  cops could rush
And you in a drop you re so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth pretty much
And trust is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers we don t sleep we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst  til you die yup
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers  ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got  em
And this was the stress I lived with
 Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin  I pray I m forgiven
For every bad decision I made every sister I played
Cause I m still paranoid to this day
And it s nobody s fault I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose or rather the life that chose me
Now it s time to say good night
Good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me Dream sweet
Dream sweet dreams for you
Not guilty
Of getting in your way while you re trying to steal the day
Not guilty
And I m not here for the rest I m not trying to steal your vest
I am not trying to be smart I only want what I can get
I m really sorry for your aging head but like you heard me said
Not guilty
Not guilty
Of being on your street getting underneath your feet
Not guilty
No use handing me a writ while I m trying to do my bit
I don t expect to take your heart I only want what I can get
I m really sorry that you re underfed but like you heard me said
Not guilty
Not guilty
For looking like a freak making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray on the road to Mandalay
I won t upset the apple cart I only want what I can get
I m really sorry that you ve been mislead but like you heard me said I m not guilty
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mum
He s the all American bulletheaded saxon mother s son
All the children sing
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce his mummy butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it s evolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don t you know you can count me out
You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We d all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We re all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all want to change the world
You ask me that it s evolution
Well you know
We don t love to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don t you know you can count me out
Hed let usinknows where wevebeen
In his octopuss garden in theshade
Id ask my friends to come and see
An octopuss gardenwithme
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hideaway beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopuss garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we cant be found
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing theyre happy and theyre safe
We would be so happy you and me
Noone there to tell us what to do
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middleofnegotiations
You break down
Inever give you my number
I onlygive you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college money spent
See no future pay no rent
All the money s gone nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning turning back
Yellow lorry slow nowhere to go
But oh that magic feeling nowhere to go
Oh that magic feeling nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we ll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes it did
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn t last
Jojolefthis home inTucson Arizona
For some California grass

Ev rybody in their neighborhood now

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody callsyouyou answer quiteslowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we re apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You re going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You re going to shout aloud
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now turns so sour
We all know ObLaDiBlaDa
But can you show me where you are
For the benefit of Mr Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons willallbe there
Late ofPablo Fanque s Fair what a scene
Overmen and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In his way Mr K will challenge the world
The celebrated Mr K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr Kite flies through the ring don t be late
Messrs K and H assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr H will demonstrate
Ten somersets he ll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr Kite is topping the bill
Oh yeah alright
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she s hit the big time
In the USA
And if she could only hear me
This is what I d say
Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie come back to me oh
Yeah
I like it like that oh ah
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me play it to me Hollywood blues
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by asilverspoon
But now shesucks her thumb and wanders
By thebanks of her own lagoon
She said she d always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob
I ll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel all right
I ll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel all right
But I don t care too much for money
I don t care too much for money
I don t care too much for money
Money can t buy me love
I ll give you all I got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
Not what I ve got I ll give to you
I don t care too much for money
I don t care too much for money
I don t care too much for money
Money can t buy me love
Everybody is laughing
Everybody is happy
Quando paramucho mi amore de felice corazn
Mundopaparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho quecanitecarousel
It goes one o clock two o clock three o clock Roc
Five six seven o clock eight o clock Roc
Eleven o clock twelve o clock the party bout to pop
Then RocAFella y all It s your boy S Dot
And I ain t never been to jail I ain t never pay a nigga
To do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell even if it means sittin in a cell
I ain t never ran never will
I ain t never been smacked a nigga better keep his hands
To himself or get clapped for what s under that man s belt
I never asked for nothin I don t demand of myself
Honesty loyalty friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt  fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn t felt which is why I ain t never played myself
I just play the hand I m dealt I can t say I ve never knelt
Before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail
But I never sat back feelin sorry for myself
If you don t give me heaven I ll raise hell
 Til it s heaven
Now if you shoot my dog I mma kill yo  cat
Just the unwritten laws in rap know dat
For every action there s a reaction don t have me relapsin
Relaxin s what I m about but about mine
Don t be actin like you can t see street action
Take me back to Reasonable Doubt time
You see my mind s on the finish line facin the wreck
I put my muh fuckin faith in the tec tell Satan not yet
You understand I am chasin my breath
I am narrowly escapin my death oh yes
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster
Travellin Mach  barrel in my apparel can stop God
God forgive me but I can t let them deliver me to you
Until I won this race then eventually
My engine gon  burn out I get whatever is meant for me
However it turns out fine red line
They say an eye for an eye we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don t make a right
But when you been wronged and you know all along that it s just one life
At what point does one fight Good question right
 Fore you knock the war try to put your dogs in his
Tenandahalfs for a minuteandahalf
Bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain t in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block niggas standin tight as lemons on the ave
Tryin to cop a shop  call theyself cleansin in the cash
But can t put they name on paper cause then you on blast
Mr President there s drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do come break bread with us
Mr Governor I swear there s a cover up
Every other corner there s a liquor store fuck is up
Born a poor young country boy Mother Nature s son
All day long I m sitting singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Find me in my field of grass Mother Nature s son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun
When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words ofwisdomlet it be
Andin my hour of darkness sheis standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
And all the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer let it be
For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer let it be
When I find myself in times of heartache Brother Malcolm comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
And in my hour of darkness he is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom let it be
Day after day alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectlystill
Butnobody wants toknow him they can see thathe s just a fool
And he never gives an answer
Well on the way head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
And nobody seems to like him they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
And he never listens to them he knows that they re the fools
They don t like him
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they re here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
There s a shadow hanging over me
I m not half the man I used to be
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Nothing to do to save his life callhiswife in
Nothing tosay but what a day how syour boy been
Nothing to do it s up to you

Good morning good morning

Going to work don t want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you re in town
Everybody knows there s nothing doing
Everything is closed it s like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you re on your own you re in the street
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed it s still the same
I ve got nothing to say but it s OK
Good morning good morning
Good morning
People running round it s five o clock
Everywhere in town it s getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It s time for tea and Meet The Wife

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church whereawedding has been
Livesin a dream
Waits at the window
Wearingthe face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there s nobody there
What does he care
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they passtheyslip away acrossthe universe
Pools of sorrow waves ofjoy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We d all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well you know
We re all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well all I can tell you is brother you have to wait
You say you ll change the constitution
Well you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it s the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
All you can
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Malcolm comes to me
Whispering words of wisdom
Let it be
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Malcolm comes to me
Whispering words of wisdom
Let it be
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He s the all American bulletheaded saxon mother s son
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
Not when he looked so fierce his mummy butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
Anna
You come and ask me girl
To set you free girl
You say he loves you more than me
So I will set you free
Go with him
Go with him
Anna
Girl before you go now
I want you to know now
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him
Anna
Just one more thing girl
You give back your ring to me and I will set you free
Go with him
Anna
Just one more thing girl
You give back your ring to me and I will set you free
Go with him

Misunderstandingall you see
It s getting hard to be someone but itallworksout
It doesn t mattermuch to me
No one I think is in my tree

That is you can t you know tune in but it s all right
That is I think it s not too bad
Always no sometimes think it s me
But you know I know when it s a dream
I think a no I mean a yes but it s all wrong
That is I think I disagree
We ve been friends for oh so long
I let you share what s mine
When you mess withthegirl I love
It stime to draw the line
I don t mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be in touch
There is something that you get straight
There s one thing you don t touch
You tell lies thinking I can tsee
Youcan t cry  causeyou re laughing at me
Man buys ringwoman throws itaway
Same old thing happen everyday
We re all alone and there nobody else
You still moan Keep your hands to yourself
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they re here to stay
OhIbelieve in yesterday
Suddenly
I mnot half the man I usedto be
There s a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday
Yesterday
I was causing everyone such pain
I couldn t tell you so I had to make this song instead
I m sorry mom for all the pain
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he s had the pleasuretoknow
And all thepeople that come and go
Stop andsay hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It s a clean machine
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she s in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange
I love you  cause you tell me things I want to know
And it s true thatitreally only goesto show
That I know that III I
Should never never never be blue
Now you re mine my happiness still makes me cry
And in time you ll understand the reason why
If I cry it s not because I m sad
But you re the only love that I ve ever had
I love you  cause you tell me things I want to know
And it s true that it really only goes to show
That I know that II I I
Should never never never be blue
If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that mybabywore

For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you it s true
Yes it is it s true

Another Terrorist attack has come again
And though Id seen it all before
Well by now Ive given up
I saw the video online
He had been ran over by a car
Its scary to think this has became regular
A crowd of people stood and stared
They hadnt seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
They were all standing by the House of lords
I saw a article today oh boy
The English army had just a made war
A number of people couldnt believe it
But It was easy for me
And maybe youll agree
I d love to turn you on
I ll be good to her
I ll make love to her
Everyone says there ll come a day
When I walk alongside of her
There isno reason for you to declare
War on the one that loves you so
So forget the other boys because my love is real
Come off your battlefield
The weapons you re using are hurting me bad
But someday you re going to see
That my love for you baby is the truest you ve ever had
A Soldier of Love that s hard to be
It s been a hard day s night
And I ve been working like a dog

Turn off your mind relax and float downstream
It is not dying it is not dying
Weweretalking about thespace between us all
And the peoplewho hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth then it s far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love we could save the world if they only knew
I love you  cause you tell me things I want to know
And it s true that it really only goes to show
That I know that II I I
Should never never never be blue
Now you re mine my happiness still makes me cry
And in time you ll understand the reason why

But you re the only love that I ve ever had

Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine callsher on the phone
Can I take you out to the pictures Joaoaoaoan
But as she s getting ready to go a knock comes on the door
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sceeeene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing  lines I must not be so o o o
But when she turns her back on the boy he creeps up from behind
I want a love that s right
But right is only half of what s wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I d hate
I ll make an early start

There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it s time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can t go on pretending day by day
That someone somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God s great big family
And the truth you know
Love is all we need
Send them your heart so they ll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand
Yes and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they re forever banned
Yes and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea
Yes and how many years can some people exist
Before they re allowed to be free
Yes and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn t see
Yes and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky
Yes and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
Yes and how many deaths will it take  til he knows
That too many people have died
There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There s too much confusion
I can t get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we ve been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl
Mama take this badge from me
I can t use it anymore
It s gettin  dark too dark to see
Feels like I m knockin  on heaven s door
Mama put my guns in the ground Ooh
I can t shoot them anymore Ooh
That cold black cloud is comin  down Ooh
Feels like I m knockin  on heaven s door Ooh
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
Id go hungry Id go black and blue
Id go crawling down the avenue
Theres nothing that I wouldnt do
To make you feel my love
I could make you happy make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldnt do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There s too much confusion
I can t get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word
Hey
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But uh but you and I we ve been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us stop talkin  falsely now
The hour s getting late
Hey
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Well uh outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey
Though I know that evening s empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And my ancient empty street s too dead for dreaming
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin  ship
My senses have been stripped my hands can t feel to grip
My toes too numb to step wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I m ready to go anywhere I m ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancin  spell my way
I promise to go under it
Though you might hear laughing spinning swinging madly across the sun
It s not aimed at anyone it s just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time it s just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn t pay it any mind
It s just a shadow you re seeing that he s chasing
And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I m thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I m ahoping for Raleigh I can see my baby tonight
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar I pick a banjo now
Oh north country winters keep agetting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain t turning back to living that old life no more
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he s a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she s the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free
Oh where have you been my blueeyed son
And where have you been my darling young one
Ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
Ive walked and Ive crawled on six crooked highways
Ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
Oh what did you see my blueeyed son
And what did you see my darling young one
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers ableeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw tenthousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And what did you hear my blueeyed son
And what did you hear my darling young one
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazing
I heard tenthousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
Oh what did you meet my blueeyed son
And who did you meet my darling young one
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman her body was burning
I met a young girl she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred
And what will you do now my blueeyed son
And what will you do now my darling young one
Im agoing back out fore the rain starts afalling
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioners face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color where none is the number
And Ill tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But Ill know my song well before I start singing
Johnny s in the basement mixin  up the medicine
I m on the pavement thinkin  about the government
The man in the trench coat badge out laid off
Says he s got a bad cough wants to get it paid off
Look out kid it s somethin  you did
God knows when but you re doin  it again
You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap in a pig pen
Wants  dollar bills  you only got
Maggie comes fleet foot face full of black soot
Talkin  that the heat put plants in the bed but
Phone s tapped anyway
Maggie says the many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the DA
Look out kid don t matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes dont tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose watch the plainclothes
You don t need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Oh get sick get well hang around a ink well
Hang bail hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard get barred get back ride rail
Get jailed jump bail join the Army if you fail
Look out kid you re gonna get hit
By losers cheaters sixtime users
Hanging  round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool s looking for a new fool
Don t follow leaders awatch the parking meters
Oh get born keep warm
Short pants romance
Learn to dance get dressed
Get blessed try to be a success
Please her please him buy gifts
Don t steal don t lift
 years of schoolin  and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole light yourself a candle
Don t wear sandals try to avoid the scandals
Don t want to be a bum you better chew gum
The pump don t work  cause the vandals took the handles
Theyre selling postcards of the hanging
Theyre painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
Theyve got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tightrope walker
The other is in his pants
Cinderella she seems so easy
It takes one to know one she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo hes moaning
You Belong to Me I Believe
And someone says Youre in the wrong place my friend
You d better leave
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortunetelling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
Ophelia shes neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twentysecond birthday
She already is an old maid
To her death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her professions her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
Einstein disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend a jealous monk
Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Dr Filth he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
Theyre trying to blow it up
Now his nurse some local loser
Shes in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
Have mercy on his soul
Across the street theyve nailed the curtains
Theyre getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then theyll kill him with selfconfidence
After poisoning him with words
At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Praise be to Neros Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybodys shouting
Which side are you on
And Ezra Pound and T S Eliot
Fighting in the captains tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Yes I received your letter yesterday
About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kinda joke
All these people that you mention
Yes I know them theyre quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she d changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama s homemade dress
Papa s bankbook wasn t big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I ve paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
We ll meet again someday
On the avenue
Tangled up in blue
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue
She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me Tell me don t I know your name
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you d never say hello she said
You look like the silent type
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now I m going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They re an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter s wives
Don t know how it all got started
I don t know what they re doing with their lives
But me I m still on the road
Aheading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue
Come you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks
You that never done nothing
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like its your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
While the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
While the young peoples blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
Youve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain t worth the blood
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that Im young
You might say Im unlearned
But theres one thing I know
Though Im younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I will follow your casket
By the pale afternoon
And Ill watch while youre lowered
Down to your deathbed
And Ill stand over your grave
 Til Im sure that youre dead
Mama take this badge off of me
I cant use it anymore
Its getting dark too dark to see
I feel Im knockin  upon heavens door
Mama put my guns in the ground
I cant shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down
I feel Im knockin  on heavens door
The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o er the Western town
She told a sad sad story
Of the great ship that went down
T was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love
The watchman he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn t stand here long
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship s bow split apart
Passengers were flying
Backward forward far and fast
They mumbled fumbled and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last
The veil was torn asunder
 Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done
The watchman lay there dreaming
At fortyfive degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere
Alarmbells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers
The rich man Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life
Calvin Blake and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark
Brother rose up  gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said The poor are yours to feed
Davey the brothelkeeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world
Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn t hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold
Leo said to Cleo
I think I m going mad
But he d lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm
Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard s curse played on
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go
There were many many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before
The watchman he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone
The captain barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears
When the Reaper s task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good the bad the rich the poor
The loveliest and the best
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God s hand
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea
If youre travelin  in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds
Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair s hangin  long
For thats the way I remember her best
Im awondering if she remembers me at all
Many times Ive often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
So if youre travelin  the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
You must leave now
Take what you need you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
The highway is for gamblers better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
All your seasick sailors they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies are all going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
Leave your stepping stones behind
There s something that calls for you
Forget the dead you ve left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who s rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
 Twas in another lifetime
One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature void of form
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
I ll always do my best for her
On that I give my word
In a world of steeleyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
Not a word was spoke between us
There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
Where it s always safe and warm
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
I was burned out from exhaustion
Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
Now there s a wall between us
Something there s been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
On an uneventful morn
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
Well the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
It s doom alone that counts
And the oneeyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
I ve heard newborn babies wailing
Like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love
Do I understand your question then
Is it hopeless and forlorn
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
And I got repaid with scorn
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
Well I m living in a foreign country
But I m bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor s edge
Someday I ll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
To when God and her were born
Come in she said I ll give ya
Shelter from the storm
When I set my eyes on you
Gonna keep you out of town at night
When I set my eyes on you
Not gonna be outta my sight
When I get my hands on you
Gonna make you carry me
When I get my hands on you
Gonna make you marry me
When I come home to you
Gonna take you down to the riverside
When I come home to you
Hold you in my arms all night
Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rolling high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
Well meet on edges soon said I
Proud  neath heated brow
Halfwracked prejudice leaped forth
Rip down all hate I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep somehow
Girls faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of though somehow
A selfordained professors tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
Equality I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
In a soldiers stance I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that Id become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Yes my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad I define these terms
Quite clear no doubt somehow
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that babys got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
Queen Mary shes my friend
Yes I believe Ill go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby cant be blessed
 Til she finally sees that shes like all the rest
With her fog her amphetamine and her pearls
Aint it clear that I just cant fit
Yes I believe its time for us to quit
But when we meet again introduced as friends
Please dont let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it s gonna sweep my world away
I wanna stop at Carbondale and keep on going
That Duquesne train gon  rock me night and day
You say I m a gambler you say I m a pimp
But I ain t neither one
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Sounding like it s on a final run
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she never blowed before
Blue light blinking red light glowing
Blowing like she s at my chamber door
You smiling through the fence at me
Just like you always smiled before
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she ain t gon  blow no more
Can t you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like the sky s gonna blow apart
You re the only thing alive that keeps me going
You re like a time bomb in my heart
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling
Must be the mother of our Lord
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like my woman s on board
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it s gon  blow my blues away
You old rascal I know exactly where you re going
I ll lead you there myself at the break of day
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed
Everybody telling me she s gone to my head
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it s gon  kill me dead
Can t you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing through another no good town
The lights on my native land are glowing
I wonder if they ll know me next time  round
I wonder if that old oak tree s still standing
That old oak tree the one we used to climb
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she s blowing right on time
McKinley hollered McKinley squalled
Doctor said McKinley death is on the wall
Say it to me ifyougot something toconfess
I heard all about it hewas going down slow
I heard it on the wireless radio
From down in the boondocks way down in Key West
Im searching for love for inspiration
On that pirate radio station
Coming out of Luxembourg and Budapest
Radio signal clear as can be
I m so deep in love that I can hardly see
Down on the flatlands way down in Key West
I was born on the wrong side of the railroad track
Like Ginsberg Corso and Kerouac
Like Louis and Jimmy and Buddy and all the rest
Well it might not be the thing to do
But I m sticking with you through and through
Down in the flatlands way down in Key West
I got both my feet planted square on the ground
Got my right hand high with the thumb down
Such is life such is happiness
Hibiscus flowers they grow everywhere here
If you wear one put it behind your ear
Down in the bottom way down in Key West
I ve never lived in the land of Oz
Or wasted my time with an unworthy cause
Its hot down here and you can t be overdressed
Tiny blossoms of a toxic plant
They can make you dizzy I d like to help you but I can t
Down in the flatlands way down in Key West
Well the Fishtail Palms and the orchid trees
They can give you that bleeding heart disease
People tell me I ought to try a little tenderness
On Amelia Street Bayview Park
Walking in the shadows after dark
Down under way down in Key West
I played Gumbo Limbo spirituals
I know all the Hindu rituals
People tell me that I m truly blessed
Bougainvillea blooming in the summer in the spring
Winter here is an unknown thing
Down in the flat lands way down in Key West
Wherever I travel wherever I roam
I m not that far from the convent home
I do what I think is right what I think is best
Mystery Street off of Mallory Square
Truman had his White House there
East bound West bound way down in Key West
Twelve years old they put me in a suit
Forced me to marry a prostitute
There were gold fringes on her wedding dress
That s my story but not where it ends
She s still cute and we re still friends
Down on the bottom way down in Key West
I play both sides against the middle
Trying to pick up that pirate radio signal
I heard the news I heard your last request
Fly around my pretty little Miss
I don t love nobody give me a kiss
Down on the bottom way down in Key West
Been beat up and battered around
Been sent up and I ve been shot down
You re the best thing that I ve ever found
Handle me with care
Reputation s changeable
Situation s tolerable
But baby you re adorable
Handle me with care
I ve been fobbed off and I ve been fooled
I ve been robbed and ridiculed
In daycare centers and night schools
Handle me with care
Been stuck in airports terrorized
Sent to meetings hypnotized
Overexposed commercialized
Handle me with care
I ve been uptight and it made a mess
But I ll clean it up myself I guess
Oh the sweet smell of success
Handle me with care
The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers theyre trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Reveres horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans Ive just been made
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
And says My advice is to not let the boys in
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
Stop all this weeping swallow your pride
You will not die its not poison
Well John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the commanderinchief
Saying Tell me great hero but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in
The commanderinchief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying Death to all those who would whimper and cry
And dropping a barbell he points to the sky
Saying The suns not yellow its chicken
The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle
The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
Causes Galileos math book to get thrown
At Delilah who s sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B DeMille
He could die happily ever after
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college
Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge
The guilty undertaker sighs
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washedout horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But its not that way
I wasnt born to lose you
The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep they wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you
Well I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that Im not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And theres nothing she doesnt see
She knows where Id like to be
But it doesnt matter
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
He spoke to me I took his flute
No I wasnt very cute to him was I
But I did it because he lied
And because he took you for a ride
Uh because time was on his side
And because I
Another day that don t end
Another ship goin  out
Another day of anger bitterness and doubt
I knowhowit happened
I sawit begin
I opened my heart tothe world and the world came in
Hello Mary Lou
Hello MissPearl
Myfleetfootedguides from theunderworld
No stars inthe sky shine brighter than you
You girls mean business and I do too
Well I m the enemy of treason
An enemy of strife
I m the enemy of the unlived meaningless life
I ain t no false prophet
I just know what I know
I go where only the lonely can go
I m first among equals
Second to none
The last of the best
You can bury the rest
Bury  em naked with their silver and gold
Put  em six feet under and I pray for their souls
What are you lookin  at
There s nothing to see
Just a cool breeze that s encircling me
Let s go for a walk in the garden
So far and so wide
We can sit in the shade by the fountainside
I search the world over
For the Holy Grail
I sing songs of love
I sing songs of betrayal
Don t care what I drink
I don t care what I eat
I climb the mountains with swords on my bare feet
You don t know me darlin
You never would guess
I m nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
I ain t no false prophet
I just said what I said
I m just here to bring vengeance on somebody s head
Put out your hand
There s nothing to hold
Open your mouth
I ll stuff it with gold
Oh you poor devil look up if you will
The city of God is there on the hill
Hello stranger
Hello and goodbye
You ruled the land
But so do I
You lusty old mule
You got a poisoned brain
I ll marry you to a ball and chain
You know darlin
The kind of life that I live
When your smile meets my smile
Something s got to give
I ain t no false prophet
No I m nobody s bride
Can t remember when I was born
And I forgot when I died
You got a lot of nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning
You got a lot of nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side thats winning
You say I let you down
You know its not like that
If youre so hurt
Why then dont you show it
You say you lost your faith
But thats not where its at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
Youre in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think Id make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he dont know to begin with
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say How are you Good luck
But you dont mean it
When you know as well as me
Youd rather see me paralyzed
Why dont you just come out once
And scream it
No I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps Id rob them
And now I know youre dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Dont you understand
Its not my problem
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
Youd know what a drag it is
To see you
Black rider black rider you ve been living too hard
Been up all night have to stayonyour guard
The paththat you re walking too narrow towalk
Every step of the way another stumbling block
The road thatyou reonsame road thatyou know
Just notthe same as it was a minute ago
Black rider black rider you ve seen it all
You ve seen the great world and you ve seen the small
You fell into the fire and you re eating the flame
Better seal up your lips if you wanna stay in the game
Be reasonable mister be honest be fair
Let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer
Black rider black rider all dressed in black
I m walking away you try to make me look back
My heart is at rest I d like to keep it that way
I don t wanna fight at least not today
Go home to your wife stop visiting mine
One of these days I ll forget to be kind
Black rider black rider tell me when tell me how
If there ever was a time then let it be now
Let me go through open the door
My soul is distressed my mind is at war
Don t hug me don t flatter me don t turn on the charm
I ll take a sword and hack off your arm
Black rider black rider hold it right there
The size of your cock will get you nowhere
I ll suffer in silence I ll not make a sound
Maybe I ll take the high moral ground
Some enchanted evening I ll sing you a song
Black rider black rider you ve been on the job too long
When you re lost in the rain in Juarez
When it s Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don t pull you through
Don t put on any airs
When you re down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outta you
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her Thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don t have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend my doctor
Won t even say what it is I ve got
Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the Goddess of Gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you re so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill
It s either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you re lookin  to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don t need you
And man they expect the same
Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the SergeantatArms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel
Who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left lookin  just like a ghost
I started out on Burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they d stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to bluff
I m going back to New York City
I do believe I ve had enough
Ive seen love go by my door
Its never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I ve been shooting in the dark too long
When somethings not right its wrong
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Dragon clouds so high above
Ive only known careless love
It always just hit me from below
But this time  round its more correct
Right on target so direct
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Purple clover Queen Anne s lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry if you dont know
Cant remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin me too much love
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mineve been like Verlaines and Rimbaud
But theres no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Ill look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You re gonna have to leave me now I know
But Ill see you in the sky above
In the tall grass in the ones I love
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
One time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt I was walking to World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kind of words he could say
He said it was a bad dream
I wouldnt worry about it none though
Them old dreams are only in your head
I said Hold it Doc a World War passed through my brain
He said Nurse get your pad the boys insane
He grabbed my arm I said Ouch
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said Tell me about it
Well the whole thing started at  oclock fast
It was all over by a quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on us
Well I got up and I walked around
Up and down the lonesome town
I stood awondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road
It was a normal day
Well I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I give a yell
Give me a string bean Im a hungry man
A shotgun fired and away I ran
I dont blame him too much though he didn t know me
Down at the corner by the hotdog stand
I seen a man
I said Howdy friend I guess theres just us two
He screamed a bit and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist
Well I spied me a girl and before she could leave
I said Lets go and play Adam and Eve
I took her by the hand and my heart was thumping
When she said Hey man you crazy or something
You seen what happened last time they started
Well I seen me a Cadillac window uptown
There was nobody around
I got into the drivers seat
And I drove down nd Street
In my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war
Well I remember seeing some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didnt pay the Con Ed bill
So the radio didnt work so well
Turned on my record player
It was Rockaday Johnny singing Tell Your Ma Tell Your Pa
Our Loves Agoing to Grow Oohwah Oohwah
I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
When you hear the beep it will be three oclock
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up
Well the doctor interrupted me just about then
Saying Hey Ive been having the same old dreams
But mine was a little different you see
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me
I didnt see you around
Well now time passed and now it seems
Everybodys having them dreams
Everybody sees their self
Walking around with no one else

Who comes around on a special night

She s got everything she needs
She s an artist she don t look back
She s got everything she needs
She s an artist she don t look back
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees
She never stumbles
She s got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She s got no place to fall
She s nobody s child
The Law can t touch her at all
She wears an Egyptian ring
It sparkles before she speaks
She wears an Egyptian ring
It sparkles before she speaks
She s a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween buy her a trumpet
And for Christmas get her a drum
I listen to you time and time again
While you tell me just what s right
And you tell me a thousand things a day
Then sleep somewhere s else at night
I m going back to Kansas City
And you call me to come then I do
And you say you made some mistake
You invite me into your house
Then you say you gotta pay for what you break
I m going back to Kansas City
Gypsy woman you know every place I go
Even a thousand miles away from home
You dont care if I m asleep or I m awake
This fickle heart just turn to stone
Going back to Kansas City
Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me offa my feet
And I m back in the rain oh oh
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You re a big girl now
Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence
He s singing his song for me at his own expense
And I m just like that bird oh oh
Singing just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears
Time is a jet plane it moves too fast
Oh but what a shame that all we ve shared can t last
I can change I swear oh oh
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too
Love is so simple to quote a phrase
You ve known it all the time I m learning it these days
Oh I know where I can find you oh oh
In somebody s room
It s a price I have to pay
You re a big girl all the way
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what s the sense of changing horses in midstream
I m going out of my mind oh oh
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we ve been apart
I crossed the Rubicon on the th day
Of the most dangerous month of the year
Attheworst time atthe worst place
That s all I seemto hear
I got up early
So I can greet the goddessofthedawn
I ve painted mywagon abandoned allhope
And I crossed the Rubicon
Well the Rubicon is a red river
Goin  gently as she flows
Redder than your ruby lips
And the blood that flows from the rose
Three miles north of purgatory
One step from the great beyond
I prayed to the cross I kissed the girls
And I crossed the Rubicon
What are these dark days I see
In this world so badly bent
I cannot redeem the time
The time so idly spent
How much longer can it last
How long can it go on
I embrace my love put down my hair
And I crossed the Rubicon
I can feel the bones beneath my skin
And they re tremblin  with rage
I ll make your wife a widow
You ll never see old age
Show me one good man in sight
That the sun shines down upon
I pawned my watch I paid my debts
And I crossed the Rubicon
Put my hide up on a hill
Where some happiness I ll find
If I survive then let me love
Let the hour be mine
Take the high road take the low
Take any one you re on
I poured the cup I passed it along
And I crossed the Rubicon
Well you defiled the most lovely flowers
In all her womanhood
Others can be tolerant
Others can be good
I ll cut you up with a crooked knife
Lord and I ll miss you when you re gone
I stood between Heaven and Earth
And I crossed the Rubicon
You won t find any happiness here
No happiness or joy
Go back to the gutter try your luck
Find you some nice pretty boy
Tell me how many men I need
And who can I count upon
I strapped my belt I buttoned my coat
And I crossed the Rubicon
I feel the holy spirit inside
See the light that freedom gives
I believe it s in the reach of
Every man who lives
Keep as far away as possible
It s darkest  fore the dawn Oh Lord
I turned the key I broke it off
And I crossed the Rubicon
Mona baby are you still in my mind
I truly believe that you are
Couldn t be anybody else but you
Who s come with me this far
The killing frost is on the ground
And the autumn leaves are gone
I lit the torch I looked to the east
And I crossed the Rubicon
Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love
Honey baby I can stand
I been meek
And hard like an oak
I ve seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive friends will disappear
If you want me
Honey baby Ill be here
I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me misery
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I aint no monkey but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
Im taking you with me
Honey baby when I go
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must
You do what you must do and you do it well
I do it for you
Honey baby cant you tell
In Scarlet Town where I was born
Theres ivy leaf and silver thorn
The streets have names that you cant pronounce
Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
The music starts and the people sway
Everybody says Are you going my way
Uncle Tom still working  for Uncle Bill
Scarlet Town is under the hill
Scarlet Town in the month of May
Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay
Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
Kissing  his face and putting  prayers on his head
So brave and true so gentle is he
Ill weep for him as he would weep for me
Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
In Scarlet Town where I was born
Scarlet Town in the hot noon hours
Theres palmleaf shadows and scattered flowers
Beggars crouching at the gate
Help comes but it comes too late
By marble slabs and in fields of stone
You make your humble wishes known
I touched the garment but the hem was torn
In Scarlet Town where I was born
In Scarlet Town the end is near
The Seven Wonders of the World are here
The evil and the good living  side by side
All human forms seem glorified
Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
See who will hold you and kiss you good night
Theres walnut groves and maplewood
In Scarlet Town crying  wont do no good
In Scarlet Town you fight your fathers foes
Up on the hill a chilly wind blows
You fight em on high and you fight  em down in
You fight  em with whiskey morphine and gin
Youve got legs that can drive men mad
A lot of things we didnt do that I wish we had
In Scarlet Town the sky is clear
Youll wish to God that you stayed right here
Set em Joe play Walking the Floor
Play it for my flatchested junkie whore
Im staying up late Im making amends
While we smile all heaven descends
If love is a sin then beauty is a crime
All things are beautiful in their time
The black and the white the yellow and the brown
Its all right there in front of you in Scarlet Town
I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong
I came to a high place of darkness and light
Dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down
A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said Are you looking for something easy to catch
Said I got no money
He said That ain t necessary
We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket and he gave me his word
I said Where are we going He said wed be back by the fourth
I said Thats the best news that Ive ever heard
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds and the worlds biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still cant remember all the best things she said
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said Theres a body Im trying to find
If I carry it out itll bring a good price
 Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind
The wind it was ahowlin  and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night
And we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hoping that it wasnt contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
There was no jewels no nothing I felt Id been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must ve been mad
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer then I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead
She said Where you been I said No place special
She said You look different I said Well I guess
She said You been gone I said Thats only natural
She said You going to stay I said If you want me to yes
Isis oh Isis you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain
The man in me will do nearly any task
And as for compensation theres little he would ask
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me
Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me
But oh what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
Sets my heart areeling
From my toes up to my ears
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein seen
But thats just because he doesnt want to turn into some machine
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me
Well I see you got your
Brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Yes I see you got your
Brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well you must tell me baby
How your head feels under something like that
Under your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well you look so pretty in it
Honey can I jump on it sometime
Yes I just want to see
If its really the expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well if you want to see the sun rise
Honey I know where
We ll go out and see it sometime
Well both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head
And you just sittin  there
In your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well I asked the doctor if I could see you
Its bad for your health he said
Yes I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you
But I found him there instead
You know I dont mind you cheatin  on me
But I sure wish hed take that off his head
Your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well I see you got a new boyfriend
You know I never seen him before
Well I saw you making love with him
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for
Its your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
They re selling postcards of the hanging
Well they re painting the passports brown
And the beauty parlor s filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Oh now look here comes the blind commissioner
Well they got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tightrope walker
The other s in his pants
Cinderella she seems so easy
Well it takes one to know one she smiles
And she puts her hands in her back pockets
Oh Bette Davis style
And now here comes Romeo moaning
You belong to me I believe
And if someone says You re in the wrong place my friend
You better leave
Now at midnight all the agents
And superhuman crew
Go out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do Knows more than they do
They re going to bring them to the factory
Where the heartattack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
It was late last night when the boss came home
To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said Boss the ladys gone
She left this morning just fore dawn
You got something to tell me tell it to me man
Come to the point as straight as you can
Old Henry Lee chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand
The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late
Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by put up a prayer The Boss
Well they rode all night and they rode all day
Eastward long down the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went
He came to a place where the light was dull
His forehead pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain
Well he threw down his helmet and his crosshandled sword
He renounced his faith he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all
He leaned down cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness caught a glimpse of the two
It was hard to tell for certain who was who
He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quaking in every vein
His knuckles were bloody he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair
They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit inseparably linked
Got a strange premonition theres a man close by Henry Lee
Dont worry about him he wouldnt harm a fly The Wife
From behind the curtain the boss he crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race
She turned she was startled with a look of surprise
With a hatred that could hit the skies
Youre a reckless fool I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by no means wise The Wife
Get up stand up you greedylipped wench
And cover your face or suffer the consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes back on doublequick The Boss
Silly boy you think me a saint
Ill listen no more to your words of complaint
Youve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes The Wife
Id have given you the stars and the planets too
But what good would these things do you
Bow the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world youll see The Boss
Oh please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold The Wife
Oh my dear you must be blind
Hes a gutless ape with a worthless mind The Boss
Youve had your way too long with me
Now its me wholl determine how things shall be The Wife
Try to escape he cussed and cursed
Youll have to try to get past me first The Boss
Do not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you sir you can not deny
You made a monkey of me what and for why The Boss
Ill have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you Ill see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle youll wish youd died Henry Lee
The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
First bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin
He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth hes as good as dead
You shot my husband down you fiend The Wife
Husband What husband What the hell do you mean
He was a man of strife a man of sin
I cut him down and threw him to the wind Henry Lee
This she said with angry breath
You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life The Wife
Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife
His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
Youre a murderous queen and a bloody wife
If you dont mind Ill have the knife Henry Lee
Were two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But were no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men as all wives know The Wife
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow
His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His tomb was sealed he slid to the floor
He whispered in her ear This is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt Henry Lee
She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
You died for me now Ill die for you The Wife
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through
All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all day
A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
Theres a woman on my lap and shes drinking champagne
Got white skin got assassins eyes
Im looking up into the sapphiretinted skies
Im well dressed waiting on the last train
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now Im expecting all hell to break loose
This place aint doing me any good
Im in the wrong town I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag
Aint no shortcuts gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think hes got anything to prove
Lot of water under the bridge lot of other stuff too
Dont get up gentlemen Im only passing through
Ive been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right the world will explode
Ive been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You cant win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street
I hurt easy I just dont show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
Im in love with a woman who dont even appeal to me
Mr Jinx and Miss Lucy they jumped in the lake
Im not that eager to make a mistake
Well I took me a woman late last night
Is threefourths drunk she looked alright
 Til she started peeling off her onion gook
Took off her wig said How do I look
I s high flying barenaked
Out the window
Well sometimes I might get drunk
Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk
Dont hurt me none it dont hurt my pride
Because I got my little lady right by my side
She s a tryin to hide pretendin  she don t know me
Is out there painting on the old woodshed
When a can of black paint it fell on my head
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub
Cost a quarter
Half price
Well my telephone rang it would not stop
Its President Kennedy calling me up
He said My friend Bob
What do we need to make the country grow
I said My friend John Brigitte Bardot
Anita Ekberg
Sophia Loren
Country ll grow
Well I got a woman five feet short
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts
She tickles my nose pats me on the head
Rolls me over and kicks me out of bed
Shes a maneater meatgrinder bad loser
Oh there ain t no use in me working all the time
I got a woman who works herself blind
Works up to her britches up to her neck
Writes me letters and sends me checks
Shes a humdinger
Folk singer
Late one day in the middle of the week
Eyes were closed I was half asleep
I chased me a woman up the hill
Right in the middle of an airraid drill
I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped a string bean
I jumped a TV dinner
I jumped a shotgun
Now the man on the stand he wants my vote
Hes arunning for office on the ballot note
Hes out there preaching in front of the steeple
Telling me he loves all kinds of people
Hes eatin  bagels
Hes eatin  pizza
Hes eatin  chitlins
Oh set me down on a television floor
Ill flip the channel to number four
Out of the shower comes a football man
With a bottle of oil in his hand
Greasy kid stuff
What I want to know Mr Football Man is
What do you do about Willy Mays
Martin Luther King
Olatunji
Well the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the greatgranddaughter of Mr Clean
She takes about fifteen baths a day
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face
Shes insane
Well they ask me why Im drunk all the time
It levels my head and eases my mind
I just walk along and stroll and sing
I see better days and I do better things
I catch dinosaurs
Make love to Elizabeth Taylor
Catch hell from Richard Burton
Tweeter and the Monkey Man were hard up for cash
They stayed up all night selling cocaine and hash
To an undercover cop who had a sister named Jan
For reasons unexplained she loved the Monkey Man
Tweeter was a boy scout  fore she went to Vietnam
And found out the hard way nobody gives a damn
They knew that they d find freedom just across the Jersey Line
So they hopped into a stolen car took Highway
The undercover cop never liked the Monkey Man
Even back in childhood he wanted to see him in the can
Jan got married at fourteen to a racketeer named Bill
She made secret calls to the Monkey Man from a mansion on the hill
It was out on Thunder Road Tweeter at the wheel
They crashed into paradise they could hear them tires squeal
The undercover cop pulled up and said Everyone of you s a liar
If you don t surrender now it s gonna go down to the wire
An ambulance rolled up a state trooper close behind
Tweeter took his gun away and messed up his mind
The undercover cop was left tied up to a tree
Near the souvenir stand by the old abandoned factory
Next day the undercover cop was hot in pursuit
He was taking the whole thing personal he didn t care about the loot
Jan had told him many times it was you to me who taught
In Jersey anything s legal as long as you don t get caught
Someplace by Rahway Prison they ran out of gas
The undercover cop had cornered  em said Boy you didn t think that this could last
Jan jumped up out of bed said There s someplace I gotta go
She took a gun out of the drawer and said It s best if you don t know
The undercover cop was found facedown in a field
The Monkey Man was on the river bridge using Tweeter as a shield
Jan said to the Monkey Man I m not fooled by Tweeter s curl
I knew him long before he ever became a Jersey girl
Now the town of Jersey City is quieting down again
I m sitting in a gambling club called A Lion s Den
The TV set was blown up every bit of it is gone
Ever since the nightly news show that the Monkey Man was on
I guess I ll go to Florida and get myself some sun
There ain t no more opportunity here everything been done
Sometimes I think of Tweeter sometimes I think of Jan
Sometimes I don t think about nothing but the Monkey Man
I m searching for phrases
To sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It s soon after midnight
And my day has just begun
A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It s soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye
My heart is cheerful
It s never fearful
I ve been down on the killing floors
I m in no great hurry
I m not afraid of your fury
I ve faced stronger walls than yours
Charlotte s a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in green
It s soon after midnight
And I ve got a date with the fairy queen
They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter
They re lying there dying in their blood
Twotiming Slim
Who s ever heard of him
I ll drag his corpse through the mud
It s now or never
More than ever
When I met you I didn t think you would do
It s soon after midnight
And I don t want nobody but you
Perhaps it is the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I m standing at
Or maybe it s the weather or something like that
But mama you ve been on my mind
I mean no trouble please don t put me down don t get upset
I am not pleading or saying I can t forget you
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent but yet
Well mama you ve been on my mind
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you ve been don t bother me or bring me down in sorrow
I don t even mind who you ll be waking with tomorrow
But mama you re just on my mind
I am not askin  you to say words like yes or no
Please understand me I have no place I m calling you to go
I m just whispering to myself so I can pretend that I don t know
Mama you re just on my mind
Well mama you re just on my mind
When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
You know I won t be next to you know I won t be near
I d just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind
Far between sundowns finish and midnights broken toll
We ducked inside the doorways thunder went crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seemin  to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Through the citys melted furnace unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless they abandoned and forsaked
Tolling for the outcast burning constantly at stake
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked it s poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leavin  only bells of lightning and it s thunder
Striking for the gentle striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
And the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in takenforgranted situations
Tolling for the deaf and blind tolling for the mute
For the mistreated mateless mother the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw chained and cheated by pursuit
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Even though a clouds white curtain in a faroff corner flared
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin
Tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail
For the lonesomehearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Starryeyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused accused misused strungout ones and worse
And for every hungup person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin
Sixteen years
Sixteen banners united over the fields
Where the good shepherd grieves
Desperate men desperate women divided
Spreading their wings  neath falling leaves
Fortune calls
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
Merchants and thieves hungry for power my last deal gone down
She s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
On Midsummer s Eve near the tower
The coldblooded moon
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid
They shaved her head
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn t help but follow
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil
I stumbled to my feet
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending  neath a heartshaped tattoo
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I d given to you
The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected
The endless road and the wailing of chimes
The empty rooms where her memory is protected
Where the angels  voices whisper to the souls of previous times
She wakes him up
Fortyeight hours later the sun is breaking
Near broken chains mountain laurel and rolling rocks
She s begging to know what measures he now will be taking
He s pulling her down and she s clutching onto his long golden locks
Gentlemen he said I don t need your organization I ve shined your shoes
I ve moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning either get ready for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards
Peace will come
With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will offer no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
Between the King and the Queen of Swords
While riding on a train going west
I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had
With halfdamp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
Our words was told our songs was sung
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied
Jokin  and talkin  about the world outside
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold
We never much thought we could get very old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
And our chances really was a million to one
As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
And our choices they were few so the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split
How many a year has passed and gone
Many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a first friend
And each one Ive never seen again
I wish I wish I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
And Id give it all gladly if our lives could be like that
I got this graveyard woman you know
She keeps my kids
But my soulful mama you know
She keeps me hid
Shes a junkyard angel and she
Always gives me bread
Well when the pipeline gets broken
And I m lost on the river bridge
Im all cracked up on the highway
And in the waters edge
Here again she comes down the thruway
Ready to sew me up with a thread
Well she dont make me nervous
She dont talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley
And she dont need no crutch
She keeps this
All loaded with lead
Well you know I
Need a steam shovel mama to
Keep away the dead
I need a dump truck baby to
Unload my head
She brings me everything and more
And just like I said
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin broken down
He looked for work and money
And he walked a ragged mile
He looked for work and money
And ya  walked a ragged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they dont know how to smile
Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre atugging at your sleeve
Your babys eyes look crazy
Theyre atugging at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If theres anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares
He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell ya
That you aint agot no friend
Your babies are crying louder now
Its apoundin  on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
Its apoundin  on your brain
Your wifes screams are stabbin  ya
Like the dirty drivin  rain
Your grass is turnin  black
Theres no water in your well
Your grass is turnin  black
Theres no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
Thats hanging on the wall
Your brain is ableedin
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your brain is ableedin
And your legs cant seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That youre holding in your hand
Theres seven breezes blowin
All around the cabin door
Theres seven breezes blowin
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the oceans poundin  roar
Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Theres seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewheres in the distance
Theres seven new people born
Oxford Town Oxford Town
Everybodys got their heads bowed down
The sun dont shine above the ground
I am agoing down to Oxford Town
He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town
Oxford Town around the bend
Come in to the door he couldnt get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that my friend
Me my girl my girls son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I dont even know why we come
Going back where we come from
Oxford Town in the afternoon
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune
Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon
It s been such a long long time
Since we loved each other when our hearts were true
One time for one brief day I was the man for you
Last night I heard you talking in your sleep
Saying things you shouldn t say oh baby
You just may have to go to jail someday
Is there a place we can go
Is there anybody we can see
Maybe it s the same for you as it is for me
I ain t seen my family in twenty years
That ain t easy to understand they may be dead by now
I lost track of em after they lost their land
Shake it up baby twist and shout
You know what it s all about
What are you doing out there in the sun anyway
Don t you know the sun can burn your brains right out
My enemy crashed into the dust
Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust
He was run down hard and he broke apart
He died in shame he had an iron heart
I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes
There are secrets in em that I can t disguise
Come back baby
If I hurt your feelings I apologize
Two trains running side by side forty miles wide
Down the eastern line
You don t have to go
I just came to you because you re a friend of mine
I think that when my back was turned
The whole world behind me burned
It s been a while
Since we walked down that long long aisle
We cried on a cold and frosty morn
We cried because our souls were torn
So much for tears
So much for these long and wasted years
Ramona
Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Will pass as your senses will rise
Oh the flowers of the city
Though breathlike
Get deathlike at times
And theres no use in trying
To deal with the dying
Though I cannot explain that in lines
Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes Im in
But it grieves my heart love
To see you trying to be a part of
A world that just dont exist
Its all just a dream babe
A vacuum a scheme babe
That sucks you into feelin  like this
I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
With the worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between staying and returning
Back to the South
Youve been fooled into thinking
That the finishing end is at hand
Yet theres no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
 cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad
Ive heard you say many times
That youre better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you gotta  be just like them
Id forever talk to you
But soon my words
Would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there s no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
Who knows baby
Ill come and be crying to you
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I m not the one you want babe
I m not the one you need
You say you re looking for someone
Who s never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
Go lightly from the ledge babe
Go lightly on the ground
I m not the one you want babe
I ll only let you down
You say you re looking for someone
Who ll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
You say you re looking for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothing more
 Twas down in Mississippi no so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door
This boy s dreadful tragedy I can still remember well
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till
Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
They said they had a reason but I can t remember what
They tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat
There was screaming sounds inside the barn there was laughing sounds out on the street
Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there and I m sure it ain t no lie
Was just for the fun of killing  him and to watch him slowly die
And then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery but nobody there seemed to mind
I saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see
The smiling brothers walking  down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free
While Emmett s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea
If you can t speak out against this kind of thing a crime that s so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men s dirt your mind is filled with dust
Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains and your blood it must refuse to flow
For you to let this human race fall down so Godawful low
This song s just a reminder to remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghostrobed Ku Klux Klan
But if all of us folks that thinks alike if we gave all we could give
We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live
Corrina Corrina
Girl where you been so long
Corrina Corrina
Girl where you been so long
I been worrying about you baby
Baby please come home
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
But I ain t got Corrina
Life dont mean a thing
Corrina Corrina
Girl youre on my mind
Corrina Corrina
Girl youre on my mind
Im asittin down thinkin of you
I just cant keep from crying
Well your railroad gate you know I just cant jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard you see
I just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight sweet Marie
Well I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes I waited for you when you hated me
Well I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
Yeah when you knew I had some other place to be
Now where are you tonight sweet Marie
Well six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
Alright so where are you tonight sweet Marie
Well I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard he follows me
Yes I can take him to your house but I cant unlock it
You see you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh where are you tonight sweet Marie
Well I been in jail when all the mail showed
That a man cant give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wondering where you are tonight sweet Marie
You say you love me
And youre thinkin  of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me
That you wanta hold me
But you know youre not that strong
I just cant do what I done before
I just cant beg you anymore
Im gonna let you pass
And Ill go last
Then time will tell just who has fell
And whos been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
You say you disturb me
And you dont deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say youre shakin
And youre always achin
But you know how hard you try
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It cant be this way everywhere
And Im gonna let you pass
Yes and Ill go last
Then time will tell who has fell
And whos been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
You say youre sorry
For tellin  stories
That you know I believe are true
You say you got some
Other kinda lover
And yes I believe you do
Say my kisses are not like his
But this time Im not gonna tell you why that is
Im just gonna let you pass
Yes and Ill go last
Then time will tell who has fell
And whos been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
If today was not a crooked highway
If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasnt such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all
Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart asoftly pounding
Yes and only if she was lying by me
Then Id lie in my bed once again
I cant see my reflection in the waters
I cant speak the sounds that show no pain
I cant hear the echo of my footsteps
Or cant remember the sound of my own name
Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart asoftly pounding
Yes and only if she was lying by me
Then Id lie in my bed once again
Theres beauty in that silver singing river
Theres beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true loves eyes
Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart asoftly pounding
Yes and only if she was lying by me
Then Id lie in my bed once again
Some of us turn off the lights and we live
With the moonlight shooting by
Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark
To be where the angels fly
Pretty maids all in a row lined up
Outside my cabin door
I ve never wanted any of them wanting me
Except the girl from the Red River Shore
Well I sat by her side and for a while I tried
To make that girl my wife
She gave me her best advice and she said
Go home and lead a quiet life
Well I been to the east and I been to the west
And I been out where the black winds roar
Somehow though I never did get that far
With the girl from the Red River Shore
Well I knew when I first laid eyes on her
I could never be free
One look at her and I knew right away
She should always be with me
Well the dream dried up a long time ago
Don t know where it is anymore
True to life true to me
Was the girl from the Red River Shore
Well I m wearing the cloak of misery
And I ve tasted jilted love
And the frozen smile upon my face
Fits me like a glove
Well I can t escape from those memories
Of the one that I ll always adore
All those nights when I lay in the arms
Of the girl from the Red River Shore
Well we re living in the shadows of a fading past
Trapped in the fires of time
I d tried not to ever hurt anybody
And to stay out of a life of crime
And when it s all been said and done
I never did know the score
One more day is another day away
From the girl from the Red River Shore
Well I m a stranger here in a strange land
But I know this is where I belong
I ll ramble and gamble for the one I love
And the hills will give me a song
Though nothing looks familiar to me
I know I ve stayed here before
Once a thousand nights ago
With the girl from the Red River Shore
Well I went back to see about her once
Went back to straighten it out
Everybody that I talked to had seen us there
Said they didn t know who I was talking about
Well the sun went down on me a long time ago
I had to go back from the door
I wish I could have spent every hour of my life
With the girl from the Red River Shore
Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago
A man full of sorrow and strife
That if someone around him died and was dead
He knew how to bring  em on back to life
Well I don t know what kind of language he used
Or if they do that kind of thing anymore
Sometimes I think nobody saw me here at all
Except the girl from the Red River Shore
Most of the time
Im clear focused all around
Most of the time
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path I can read the signs
Stay right with it when the road unwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I dont even notice she gone
Most of the time
Most of the time
Its well understood
Most of the time
I wouldnt change it if I could
I can make it all match up I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive I can endure
And I dont even think about her
Most of the time
Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
Im strong enough not to hate
I dont build up illusion till it makes me sick
I aint afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Dont even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time
Most of the time
Im halfway content
Most of the time
I know exactly where it all went
I dont cheat on myself I dont run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I dont compromise and I dont pretend
I dont even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time
I ain t lookin  to compete with you
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
Simplify you classify you
Deny defy or crucify you
All I really want to do
Is baby be friends with you
No and I ain t lookin  to fight with you
Frighten you or uptighten you
Drag you down or drain you down
Chain you down or bring you down
All I really want to do
Is baby be friends with you
I ain t lookin  to block you up
Shock or knock or lock you up
Analyze you categorize you
Finalize you or advertise you
All I really want to do
Is baby be friends with you
I dont wanta  straightface you
Race or chase you track or trace you
Or disgrace you or displace you
Or define you or confine you
All I really want to do
Is baby be friends with you
I dont wanta  meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you
All I really want to do
Is baby be friends with you
I dont wanta  fake you out
Take or shake or forsake you out
I ain t lookin  for you to feel like me
See like me or be like me
All I really want to do
Is baby be friends with you
Seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Well I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes amoaning
Hear that undertakers bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Theres a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
Hes dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
Theres a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
Well God is in His heaven
And we all want whats His
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
Im gazing out the window
Of the St James Hotel
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
If I had wings
Like Noah s Dove
Id fly the river
To the one I love
Fare thee well my honey
Fare thee well
I had a man
Who was long and tall
Moved his body
Like a cannonball
Fare thee well my honey
Fare thee well
Remember one evening
Was drizzling rain
And around my heart
I felt an aching pain
Fare thee well my honey
Fare thee well
Once I wore
My apron low
Couldnt keep you
Away from my door
Fare thee well my honey
Fare thee well
Now my apron
Is up to my chin
You pass my door
But you never come in
Fare thee well my honey
Fare thee well
Oh mighty river
Runs muddy and wild
Cant care the bloody
For my unborn child
Fare thee well my honey
Fare thee well
Number  train
Wont do no harm
Number  train
Take my poor baby home
Fare thee well my honey
Fare thee well
Fastest man
I ever saw
Skipped Missouri
On the way to Arkansas
Fare thee well my honey
Fare thee well
I know that it s over
But I can t believe we re through
They said that time s a healer
And I m better without you
It s gonna take time I know
But I ll get over you
Caught up in my thinking yeah
Like a prisoner in my mind
You pose so many questions
But the truth was hard to find
I better think twice I know
That I ll get over you
Ring them bells ye heathen
From the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
Cross the valleys and streams
For theyre deep and theyre wide
And the worlds on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride
Ring them bells St Peter
Where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know
Oh its rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow
Ring them bells Sweet Martha
For the poor mans son
Ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one
Oh the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled
With lost sheep
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When innocence dies
Ring them bells St Catherine
From the top of the room
Ring them from the fortress
For the lilies that bloom
Oh the lines are long
And the fighting is strong
And theyre breaking down the distance
Between right and wrong
Mama take this badge from me
I can t use it anymore
It s getting dark too dark to see
I feel I m knockin  on heaven s door
Mama put my guns in the ground
I can t shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin  around
And I feel I m knockin  on heaven s door
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Feels like I am
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Feels like I am
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Feels like I am
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Mama tell me
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Feels like I m
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Feels like I am
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
Knock knock knockin  on heaven s door
I might be in Colorado
Or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
Don t you breathe it to nobody because you know I m on the lamb
Wanted man by Lucy Watson
Wanted man by Jeannie Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson
Wanted man in this next town
I ve had all that I wanted of a lot of things I ve had
And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad
I got sidetracked in El Paso
Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Juarez with Juanita on my lap
Went to sleep in Shreveport
Woke up in Abilene
Wondering why I m wanted at some town half way in between
Wanted man in Albuquerque
Wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee
Wanted man in Baton Rouge
There s somebody set to grab me
Anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight
You might get a glimpse of me
I m walking through the summer nights
The jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was going too fast
Today it s moving too slow
I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don t know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn t matter to you anyhow
You left me standing in the doorway crying
I got nothing to go back to now
The light in this place is so bad
Making me sick in the head
All the laughter is just making me sad
The stars have turned cherry red
I m strumming on my gay guitar
Smoking a cheap cigar
The ghost of our old love has not gone away
Don t look it like it will anytime soon
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Under the midnight moon
Maybe they ll get me and maybe they won t
But not tonight and it won t be here
There are things I could say but I don t
I know the mercy of God must be near
I ve been riding a midnight train
Got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against every rule
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Suffering like a fool
When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy youll roll no more
I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
I wonder who they re ringing for
I know I can t win
But my heart just won t give in
Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one
You left me standing in the doorway crying
In the dark land of the sun
I eat when I m hungry drink when I m dry
And live my life on the square
And even if the flesh falls off of my face
I know someone will be there to care
It always means so much
Even the softest touch
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
There s no words that need to be said
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Blues wrapped around my head
You may be an ambassador to England or France
You may like to gamble you might like to dance
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls
You might be a rock n roll addict prancing on the stage
You might have drugs at your command women in a cage
You may be a business man or some highdegree thief
They may call you Doctor or they may call you Chief
You may be a state trooper you might be a young Turk
You may be the head of some big TV network
You may be rich or poor you may be blind or lame
You may be living in another country under another name
You may be a construction worker working on a home
You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome
You might own guns and you might even own tanks
You might be somebodys landlord you might even own banks
You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride
You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side
You may be working in a barbershop
You may know how to cut hair
You may be somebodys mistress may be somebodys heir
Might like to wear cotton might like to wear silk
Might like to drink whiskey might like to drink milk
You might like to eat caviar you might like to eat bread
You may be sleeping on the floor sleeping in a kingsized bed
You may call me Terry you may call me Timmy
You may call me Bobby you may call me Zimmy
You may call me RJ you may call me Ray
You may call me anything but no matter what you say
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
I d go hungry I d go black and blue
I d go crawling down the avenue
No there s nothing that I wouldn t do
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love
I could make you happy make your dreams come true
There s nothing that I wouldn t do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love
Crickets are chirping the water is high
Theres a soft cotton dress on the line hangin dry
Window wide open African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye not even a note
She gone with the man
In the long black coat
Somebody seen him hanging around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the Bible hed quote
There was dust on the man
In the long black coat
Preacher was a talkin theres a sermon he gave
He said every mans conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When its you who must keep it satisfied
It aint easy to swallow it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man
In the long black coat
There are no mistakes in life some people say
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
But people don t live or die people just float
She went with the man
In the long black coat
Theres smoke on the water its been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted  neath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
Somebody is out there beating a dead horse
She never said nothing there was nothing she wrote
She gone with the man
In the long black coat
Oh its fare thee well my darling true
Im leaving in the first hour of the morn
Im bound off for the bay of Mexico
Or maybe the coast of Californ
So its fare thee well my own true love
Well meet another day another time
It aint the leavin
Thats agrievin me
But my true love whos bound to stay behind
Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
And the rain shes aturnin into hail
I still might strike it lucky on a highway going west
Though Im traveling on a path beaten trail
So its fare thee well my own true love
Well meet another day another time
It aint the leaving
Thats agrievin me
But my true love whos bound to stay behind
I will write you a letter from time to time
As Im rambling you can travel with me too
With my head my heart and my hands my love
I will send what I learn back home to you
So its fare thee well my own true love
Well meet another day another time
It aint the leaving
Thats agrievin me
But my true love whos bound to stay behind
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles
Be them somebody elses or my own
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high
I will travel unnoticed and unknown
So its fare thee well my own true love
Well meet another day another time
It aint the leaving
Thats agrievin me
But my true love whos bound to stay behind
Ive heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound
Its down around the old Mexican plains
They say that the people are all friendly there
And all they ask of you is your name
So its fare thee well my own true love
Well meet another day another time
It aint the leaving
Thats agrievin me
But my true love whos bound to stay behind
You got me in a corner
You got me against the wall
I got nowhere to go
I got nowhere to fall
Take back your insurance
Baby nothing is guaranteed
Take back your acid rain
Let your TV bleed
Take back your angry slander
Take back your pension plan
Take back your ups and downs of your life in raisinland
Take back Vanessa Redgrave
Take back Joe Piscopo
Take back Eddie Murphy
Give  em all some place to go
Take back Pasadena
Take back El Salvador
Take back that country club
They re trying to build outside my door
When the rain s blowin  in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I would offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evenin  shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven t made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I ve known it from the moment that we met
It s no doubt in my mind where you belong
I d go hungry I d go black and blue
I d go crawlin  down the avenue
There ain t nothin  that I wouldn t do
To make you feel my love
The storms are ragin  on the rollin  sea
Down on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowin  wild and free
But you ain t seen nothin  like me yet
There ain t nothin  that I wouldn t do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
Make you happy make your dreams come true
To make you feel my love
May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the wind changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
I pounded on a farmhouse
Looking for a place to stay
I was mighty mighty tired
I d come a long long way
I said Hey hey in there
Is there anybody home
I was standin  on the steps
Feeling most alone
When out comes a farmer
He must ve thought that I was nuts
He immediate looked at me
And stuck a gun into my guts
I fell down
To my bended knees
Saying I dig farmers
Dont shoot me please
He cocked his rifle
And begin to shout
Are you that travelin  salesman
That I have heard about
I said No No No
Im a doctor and its true
Im a cleancut kid
And I been to college too
Then in comes his daughter
Whose name was Rita
She looked like she stepped out of
La Dolce Vita
I immediately tried to cool it
With her dad
And told him what a
Nice pretty farm he had
He said What do doctors
Know about farms pray tell
I said I s born
At the bottom of a wishing well
Well by the dirt  neath my nails
I guess he knew I wouldnt lie
He said I guess youre tired
He said it kind of sly
I said Yes ten thousand miles
Today I drove
He said I got a bed for you
Underneath the stove
Just one condition
You can go to sleep right now
That you dont touch my daughter
And in the morning milk the cows
I was sleeping like a rat
When I heard something jerkin
There stood Rita
Looking just like Tony Perkins
She said Would you like to take a shower
Ill show you up to the door
I said Oh no no
Ive been through this movie before
I knew I had to split
But I did not know how
When she said
Would you like to take that shower now
Well I couldnt leave
Unless the old man chased me out
Because Id already promised
That Id milk his cows
I had to say somethin
To strike him very weird
So I yelled out
I like Fidel Castro and his beard
Rita looked offended
But she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs
Sayin  Whats that I heard you say
I said I like Fidel Castro
I think you heard me right
And I ducked as he swung
At me with all his might
Rita mumbled somethin
 bout her mother on the hill
As his fist it hit the icebox
He said hes gonna kill me
If I dont get out the door
In two seconds flat
You unpatriotic
Rotten doctor Commie rat
Well he threw a Readers Digest
At my head and I did run
I did a somersault
As I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window
At a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast
In his garden flowers
Rita said Come back
As he started to load
The sun was coming up
And I was running down the road
Well I dont figure Ill be back
There for a spell
Even though Rita moved away
And got a job in a motel
He still waits for me
Constant on the sly
He wants to turn me in
To the FBI
Me I romp and stomping
Thankful as I romp
Without freedom of speech
I might be in the swamp
I dreamed I saw St Augustine
Alive as you or me
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold
Arise arise he cried so loud
With a voice without restraint
Come out ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own
But go on your way accordingly
But know youre not alone
I dreamed I saw St Augustine
Alive with fiery breath
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death
Oh I awoke in anger
So alone and terrified
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried
Farewell Angelina
The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits
I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles
The music play slow
But farewell Angelina
The night is on fire
And I must go
There is no use in talking
And there s no need for blame
There is nothing to prove
Evrything still is the same
A table stands empty
By the edge of the stream
But farewell Angelina
The sky s changing colours
And I must leave
The jacks and the queens
They forsake the courtyard
Fiftytwo gypsies
Now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce
And the ace once ran wild
Farewell Angelina
The sky is folding
I ll see you after a while
See the crosseyed pirates sitting
Perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans
With a sawedoff shotgun
And the corporals and neighbors
Clap and cheer with each blast
Farewell Angelina
The sky it is trembling
And I must leave fast
King Kong little elves
In the rooftoops they dance
Valentinotype tangos
While the hero s clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead
Not to embarrass anyone
Farewell Angelina
The sky is flooding over
And I must be gone
The camouflaged parrot
He flutters from fear
When something he doesn t know about
Suddenly appears
What cannot be imitated
Perfect must die
Farewell Angelina
The sky s flooding over
And I must go where it is dry
Machine guns are roaring
Puppets heave rocks
At misunderstood visions
And at the faces of clocks
Call me any name you like
I will never deny it
But farewell Angelina
The sky is erupting
And I must go where it s quiet
Crimson flames tied through my years
Flowing high and mighty trapped
Countless fire and flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
We ll meet on edges soon said I
Proud  neath heated brow
Halfwracked prejudice leaped forth
Rip down all hate I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull I dreamed
Romantic flanks of musketeers
Foundationed deep somehow
In a soldier s stance I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I d become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
Sisters fled by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
My guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad I define these terms
Quite clear no doubt somehow
Shadows are falling and Ive been here all day
Its too hot to sleep and time is running away
I feel like my soul has turned into steel
Ive still got the scars that the sun didnt let me heal
Theres not even room enough to be anywhere
Well my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing theres been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing what was in her mind
I just dont see why I should even care
Well Ive been to London and Ive been to gay Paris
Ive followed the river and I got to the sea
Ive been down to the bottom of a world full of lies
I aint lookin  for nothing in anyones eyes
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear
I was born here and Ill die here against my will
I know it looks like Im moving but Im standing still
Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb
I cant even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Dont even hear a murmur of a prayer
The air is getting hotter
Theres a rumbling in the skies
Ive been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesnt haunt me like it did before
Ive been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
Ive been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts abeatin
Like pendulums swinging on chains
When you think that you ve lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
Im just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
Im going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I dont know what all right even means
I was riding in a buggy with Miss MaryJane
Miss MaryJane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world boys
Now Im trying to get to heaven before they close the door
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
Ill close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Some trains don t pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers like they did before
I been to Sugar Town I shook the sugar down
Now Im trying to get to heaven before they close the door
I once held her
In my arms
She said she would
Always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool
I threw it all away
Once I had mountains
In the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through
Every day
But I must have been mad
I never knew what I had
Until I threw it all away
So if you find someone
Who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart dont let it stray
For one thing for certain
You will surely be ahurtin
If you throw it all away
If you throw it all away
My mother was a tailor she sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler Lord down in New Orleans
Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time when he s satisfied is when he s on a drunk
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he ll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town
Oh tell my baby sister not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the rising sun
Well with one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train
I m going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain
I m going back to New Orleans my race is almost run
I m going back to end my life down in the rising sun
Rambling out of the wild West
Leaving the towns I love the best
Thought Id seen some ups and downs
 Til I come into New York town
People going down to the ground
Buildings going up to the sky
Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowing snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didnt feel so cold then
I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking reeling rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village
I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffeehouses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singers here
Well I got a harmonica job begun to play
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved my sound
He was raving about how he loved my sound
Dollar a days worth
And after weeks and weeks of hanging around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid my dues
Now a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It didnt take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin about
A lot of people dont have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks n knives
And they got to cut something
So one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies
So long New York
Howdy East Orange
Well there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck
Well the marshal now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
Turn him loose let him go let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what its like to every moment face his death
Well I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes arolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I cant believe weve lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train
I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah but you were right It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel
Well we drove that car all night into San Anton
And we slept near the Alamo your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didnt feel like letting my head get blown off
Well were driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies
Now I know she aint you but shes here and shes got that dark rhythm in her soul
But Im too over the edge and I aint in the mood anymore to remember the times
When I was your only man
And she dont want to remind me She knows this car would go out of control
Well we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live He owned a Wreckin lot outside of town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes she had her red hair tied back She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said Henry aint here but you can come on in hell be back in a little while
Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking of
Bumming a ride back from where she started
But ya know she changed the subject every time money came up
She said Welcome to the land of the living dead
You could tell she was so broken hearted
She said Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt
How far are yall going Ruby asked us with a sigh
Were going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn
Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies
Ruby just smiled and said Ah you know some babies never learn
Something about that movie though well I just cant get it out of my head
But I cant remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be looking my way
Well they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossing the street when shots rang out
I didnt know whether to duck or to run so I ran
We got him cornered in the churchyard I heard somebody shout
Well you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune Underneath it
It said A man with no alibi
You went out on a limb to testify for me you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do
Now Ive always been the kind of person that doesnt like to trespass
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line
Oh if theres an original thought out there I could use it right now
You know I feel pretty good but that is not saying much I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how
Well Im standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeah but you know its not the one that I had in mind
Hes got a new one out now I dont even know what its about
But Ill see him in anything so Ill stand in line
You know its funny how things never turn out the way you had em planned
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasnt Henry Porter
And you know there was something about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked
That I left behind in the French Quarter
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content
I dont have any regrets they can talk about me plenty when Im gone
You always said people dont do what they believe in they just do whats most convenient then they repent
And I always said Hang on to me baby and lets hope that the roof stays on
There was a movie I seen one time I think I sat through it twice
I dont remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck he wore a gun
And he was shot in the back
Seems like a long time ago long before the stars were torn down
Man thinks because he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things dont change soon he will
Oh man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon
Now they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where hes bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars
Now hes hellbent for destruction hes afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes they just tell him lies
You may be a noisemaker spirit maker
Heartbreaker backbreaker
Leave no stone unturned
May be an actor in a plot
That might be all that you got
Till your error you clearly learn
Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection hes fulfilled
Oh man is opposed to fair play
He wants it all and he wants it his way
They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
So I swear I see my reflection
Some where instead these wall
Yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he s not to blame
All day long I hear him hollering so loud
Just crying out that he s not to blame
Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
She smiles walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay
As the morning light breaks open the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
Pardon monsieur the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
Am I hearing you right
And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinking hes the Soviet Ambassador
She starts to speak but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes the lights blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
Can you see anything
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says Open up another deck
But the dealer says Attendezvous sil vous plait
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the womans hand
Said Heres a ring it cost a grand
She said That ain t enough
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horsedrawn taxi waited at the curb
She passed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read Do Not Disturb
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay
Ive got to talk to someone quick
But the Greek said Go away and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried Help theres danger near
Please open up the door
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love
But the desk clerk said It happens every day
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay
As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
The dealer said Its too late now
You can take your money but I dont know how
Youll spend it in the tomb
The tiny man bit the soldiers ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
While shes out on the balcony where a stranger tells her
My darling je vous aime beaucoup
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay
I was sitting home alone one night in LA
Watching old Cronkite on the seven oclock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes
Didnt seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
Theres another hardluck story that youre going to hear
And theres really nothing anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay
Oh the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
Theyre drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers  pearls and all I see are dark eyes
A cock is crowing far away and another soldiers deep in prayer
Some mothers child has gone astray she cant find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom natures beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand Im sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes
Oh the French girl shes in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes
I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
Its very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love just me and you
Theres lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance
Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land
And when its time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why its so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique
Broken bottles broken plates
Broken switches broken gates
Broken dishes broken parts
Streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Everything is broken
Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Something else just hit the ground
Broken cutters broken saws
Broken buckles broken laws
Broken bodies broken bones
Broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath feel like youre choking
Everything is broken
Every time you leave and go off someplace
Things fall to pieces in my face
I could have told you
She d hurt you
She d you love you a while
Then desert you
If only you asked
I could have told you so
I could have saved you
Some crying
Yes I could have told you she s lying
But you were in love
And didn t want to know
There s an evening  haze settlin  over the town
Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin  power of the proletariat s gone down
Money s gettin  shallow and weak
The place I love best is a sweet memory
It s a new path that we trod
They say low wages are a reality
If we want to compete abroad
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
I m listening  to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping it s way into my gut
Now I m sailing  on back ready for the long haul
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I ll drag them all down to hell and I ll stand them at the wall
I ll sell them to their enemies
I m trying  to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can t give it away
Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man no woman knows
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover s breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death
Well they burned my barn they stole my horse
I can t save a dime
I got to be careful I don t want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see
Tell me now am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I ll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You ve wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It s all true everything you have heard
In you my friend I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They ll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so
Now I m down on my luck and I m black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I m all alone and I m expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don t know what work even means
Can I come home with you
Baby can I come home with you
Yes I ll do anything in this Godalmighty world
If you just let me come home with you
It was just the other day
I was bringing home my pay
When I met an old friend I used to know
Said your mothers dead and gone
Baby sisters all gone wrong
And your daddy needs you home right away
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny on my name
Well I cant go home Thisaway
Thisaway Lord Lord Lord
And I cant go home Thisaway
If you miss the train Im on
Count the days Im gone
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles honey baby Lord Lord Lord
And youll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
Im playing on a track
Ma would come and whoop me back
On them trestles down by old Jim McKays
When I pay the debt I owe
To the commissary store
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home
Go home Lord Lord Lord
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home
Used to tell Ma sometimes
When I see them riding blinds
Going to make me a home out in the wind
In the wind Lord in the wind
Make me a home out in the wind
I dont like it in the wind
Want to go back home again
But I cant go home Thisaway
Thisaway Lord Lord Lord
And I cant go home Thisaway
Well the neighborhood bully hes just one man
His enemies say hes on their land
They got him outnumbered about a million to one
He got no place to escape to no place to run
Hes the neighborhood bully
The neighborhood bully just lives to survive
Hes criticized and condemned for being alive
Hes not supposed to fight back hes supposed to have thick skin
Hes supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in
Hes the neighborhood bully
The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land
Hes wandered the earth an exiled man
Seen his family scattered his people hounded and torn
Hes always on trial for just being born
Hes the neighborhood bully
Well he knocked out a lynch mob he was criticized
Old women condemned him said he should apologize
Then he destroyed a bomb factory nobody was glad
The bombs were meant for him He was supposed to feel bad
Hes the neighborhood bully
Well the chances are against it and the odds are slim
That hell live by the rules that the world makes for him
Because theres a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
And a license to kill him is given out to every maniac
Hes the neighborhood bully
He got no allies to really speak of
What he gets he must pay for he dont get it out of love
He buys obsolete weapons and he wont be denied
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side
Hes the neighborhood bully
Well hes surrounded by pacifists who all want peace
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease
Now they wouldnt hurt a fly To hurt one they would weep
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep
Hes the neighborhood bully
Every empire thats enslaved him is gone
Egypt and Rome even the great Babylon
Hes made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
In bed with nobody under no ones command
Hes the neighborhood bully
Now his holiest books have been trampled upon
No contract he signed was worth what it was written on
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health
Hes the neighborhood bully
Whats anybody indebted to him for
Nothing they say He just likes to cause war
Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed
Hes the neighborhood bully
What has he done to wear so many scars
Does he change the course of rivers Does he pollute the moon and stars
Neighborhood bully standing on the hill
Running out the clock time standing still
Neighborhood bully
I m going down to Rose Marie s
She never does me wrong
She puts it to me plain as day
And gives it to me for a song
It s a wicked life but what the hell
Everybody s got to eat
And I m just the same as anyone else
When it comes to scratching for my meat
Now whenever I get up
And I can t find what I need
I just make it down to Rose Marie s
And get something quick to eat
It s not a bad way to make a living
And I ain t complainin  none
Oh I can pull my plum and drink my rum
And then go on home and have my fun
Now if someone offers me a joke
I just say no thanks
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks
Well every time you know when the well breaks down
I just go pump on it some
Rose Marie she likes to go to big places
And just set there waitin  for me to come
Gypsy gal the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat
Your temperature is too hot for taming
Your flaming feet are burning up the street
I m homeless come and take me
To the reach of your rattlin  drums
Let me know babe all about my fortune
Down along my restless palms
Gypsy gal you got me swallowed
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes so fast and slashing
And your flashing diamond teeth
The night is pitch black come an make my
Pale face fit into place ah please
Let me know babe Im nearly drowning
If its you my lifelines trace
I been wondering all about me
Ever since I seen you there
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms Im riding
I know Im around you but I dont know where
You have slayed me you have made me
I got to laugh half ways off my heels
I got to know babe yeah will you surround me
So I can know if Im really real
Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door
I dont need them anymore
 Cause tonight Ill be staying here with you
I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do
Oh your love comes on so strong
And Ive waited all day long
For tonight when Ill be staying here with you
I can hear that whistle blowin
I see that stationmaster too
If theres a poor boy on the street
Then let him have my seat
 Cause tonight Ill be staying here with you
Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door
I dont need them anymore
 Cause tonight Ill be staying here with you
Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams
Think Ill go out and go for a walk
Not much happening here nothing ever does
Besides if she wakes up now shell just want me to talk
I got nothing to say specially about whatever was
Took an untrodden path once where the swift dont win the race
It goes to the worthy who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justices beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
Outside of two men on a train platform theres nobody in sight
Theyre waiting for spring to come smoking down the track
The world could come to an end tonight but thats all right
She should still be there sleepin when I get back
Noontime and Im still pushing myself along the road the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes I cant stumble or stay put
Someone else is speaking with my mouth but Im listening only to my heart
Ive made shoes for everyone even you while I still go barefoot
We live in a political world
Love dont have any place
Were living in times where men commit crimes
And crime dont have a face
We live in a political world
Icicles hanging down
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Clouds cover up the ground
We live in a political world
Wisdom is thrown into jail
It rots in a cell is misguided as hell
Leaving no one to pick up a trail
We live in a political world
Where mercy walks the plank
Life is in mirrors death disappears
Up the steps into the nearest bank
We live in a political world
Where courage is a thing of the past
Houses are haunted children are unwanted
The next day could be your last
We live in a political world
The one we can see and can feel
But theres no one to check its all a stacked deck
We all know for sure that its real
We live in a political world
In the cities of lonesome fear
Little by little you turn in the middle
But youre never sure why youre here
We live in a political world
Under the microscope
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
You always got more than enough rope
We live in a political world
Turning and athrashing about
As soon as youre awake youre trained to take
What looks like the easy way out
We live in a political world
Where peace is not welcome at all
Its turned away from the door to wander some more
Or put up against the wall
We live in a political world
Everything is hers or his
Climb into the frame and shout Gods name
But youre never sure what it is
Fat man looking in a blade of steel
Thin man looking at his last meal
Hollow man looking in a cotton field
For dignity
Wise man looking in a blade of grass
Young man looking in the shadows that pass
Poor man looking through painted glass
For dignity
Somebody got murdered on New Years Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun
Searching high searching low
Searching everywhere I know
Asking the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity
Blind man breaking out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hoping to find one circumstance
Of dignity
I went to the wedding of Mary Lou
She said I dont want nobody see me talking to you
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity
I went down where the vultures feed
I wouldve gone deeper but there wasnt any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasnt any difference to me
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window going to ask the maid
Have you seen dignity
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of coveredup mirrors
Looking into the lost forgotten years
For dignity
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said hed give me information if his name wasnt used
He wanted money up front said he was abused
By dignity
Footprints running across the silver sand
Steps going down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the border towns of despair
Got no place to fade got no coat
Im on the rolling river in a jerkin boat
Trying to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity
Sick man looking for the doctors cure
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity
Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combing his hair back his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams
So many roads so much at stake
So many dead ends Im at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what its going to take
To find dignity
I was thinking of a series of dreams
Where nothing comes up to the top
Everything stays down where its wounded
And comes to a permanent stop
Wasnt thinking of anything specific
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams
Nothing too very scientific
Just thinking of a series of dreams
Thinking of a series of dreams
Where the time and the tempo fly
And theres no exit in any direction
Cept the one that you cant see with your eyes
Wasnt making any great connection
Wasnt falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams
In one numbers were burning
In another I witnessed a crime
In one I was running and in another
All I seemed to be doing was climb
Wasnt looking for any special assistance
Not going to any great extremes
Id already gone the distance
Just thinking of a series of dreams
Oh where have you been my blueeyed son
And where have you been my darling young one
Ive stumbled down the side of twelve misty mountains
Ive walked and Ive crawled on six crooked highways
Ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
Oh what did you see my blueeyed son
And what did you see my darling young one
I saw a newborn baby with wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
And what did you hear my blueeyed son
And what did you hear my darling young one
I heard the sound of thunder that roared out a warning
I heard one person starve I heard many people laughing
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazing
And what will you do my blueeyed son
And what will you do my darling young one
Ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where hunger is ugly where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the colour and none is the number
Then Ill stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But Ill know my song well before I start singing
Sign on the window says Lonely
Sign on the door said No company allowed
Sign on the street says Y dont own me
Sign on a porch says threes a crowd
Sign on a porch says threes a crowd
Her and her boyfriend went to California
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune
My best friend said Now didn t I warn you
Brighton girls are like the moon
Brighton girls are like the moon
Build me a cabin in Utah
Marry me a wife catch rainbow trout
Have a bunch of kids who call me Pa
That must be what its all about
That must be what its all about
Well I saw it advertised one day
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way
Come along and take a trip
We ll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and family
Bring the whole kids
Yippee
Well I run right down and bought a ticket
To this thing called the Bear Mountain picnic
Little did I realize
I was in for a pleasant funny surprise
Had nothing to do with picnic
Didn t come close to a mountain
And I hate bears
Took the wife and kids down to the pier
There was six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
Oh well I said it s a pretty big ship
Besides anyhow the more the merrier
Well we all got on and what do you think
That big old boat started to sink
More people kept apiling on
That old ship was agoing down
Funny way to start a picnic
Well I soon lost track of my kids and wife
So many people I never saw in my life
That old ship was sinking down in the water
There was six thousand people trying to kill each other
Dogs abarking cats ascreaming
Women ayelling men aflying fists aflying
Paper flying cops acoming me arunning
Maybe we just better call off the picnic
I got shoved down got pushed around
All I remember was a moanin  sound
Don t remember one thing more
All I remember is waking up on the shore
My arms and legs were broken
My feet were splintered
My head was cracked
I couldn t walk
I couldn t talk smell feel
Couldn t see
Didn t know where I was
I was bald
Quite lucky to be alive though
Well feeling like I just climbed out of my casket
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
Took the wife and kids and started home
Wishing I d never got up that mornin
Now I don t care just what you do
If you want a have a picnic that s up to you
But don t tell me about it I don t want to hear it
You see I just lost all my picnic spirit
Stay in my kitchen have my own picnic
Have a picnic in the bathroom
Well it don t seem to me quite so funny
What some people are going to do for money
There s a brand new gimmick every day
Just to take somebody s money away
I think we ought to take some of these people
And put them on a boat send them up to Bear Mountain
For a picnic
I love you more than ever more than time and more than love
I love you more than money and more than the stars above
Love you more than madness more than waves upon the sea
Love you more than life itself you mean that much to me
Ever since you walked right in the circles been complete
Ive said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I havent yet begun
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul
You gave me babies one two three what is more you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you dont ever rest theyd kill me if I lie
Id sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die
The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
Well play it out the best we know whatever it is worth
Whats lost is lost we cant regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood
Its never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge
Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesnt bend
And if there is eternity Id love you there again
Oh cant you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you you were born to be my bride
Youre the other half of what I am youre the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesnt cease
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go no matter what goes on
Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone
As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were danglin  from the vine
I was passin  by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind
Ain t talkin  just a walkin
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burnin  still yearnin
No one on earth would ever know
They say prayer has the power to help
So pray from the mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I m a tryin  to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh mother things ain t goin  well
Ain t talkin  just a walkin
I ll burn that bridge before you can cross
Heart burnin  still yearnin
They ll be no mercy for ya  once you ve lost
Now I m all worn down by weepin
My eyes are filled with tears my lips are dry
If I catch my opponents ever sleepin
I ll just slaughter them where they lie
Ain t talkin  just a walkin
Through the world mysterious and vague
Heart burnin  still yearnin
Walkin  a through the cities of the plague
Well the whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you re down
Ain t talkin  just a walkin
Eatin  hogeyed grease in a hogeyed town
Heart burnin  still yearnin
Someday you ll be glad to have me around
They will crush you with wealth and power
Every wakin  moment you could crack
I ll make the most of one last extra hour
I ll avenge my father s death an  I ll step back
Ain t talkin  just walkin
Hand me down my walkin  cane
Heart burnin  still yearnin
Got to get ya  out of my miserable brain
All o  my loyal and muchloved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that s been long abandoned
Ain t no altars on this long and lonesome road
Ain t talkin  just a walkin
My mule is sick my horse is blind
Heart burnin  still yearnin
Thinkin  bout that gal I left behind
Well it s bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin
Who says I can t get heavenly aid
Ain t talkin  just a walkin
Carryin  a dead man s shield
Heart burnin  still yearnin
A walkin  a with a toothache in my heel
The sufferin  is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I m a not playin  I m not pretending
I m not nursin  any superfluous fears
Ain t talkin  just a walkin
Walkin  ever since the other night
Heart burnin  still yearnin
Walkin  til I ma clean outta sight
As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day a hot summer lawn
Excuse me ma am I beg your pardon
There s no one here the gardener is gone
Ain t talkin  a just a walkin
Up the road around the bend
Heart burnin  still yearnin
In the last outback at the world s end
Nooooo no no noooo
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows
That baby s got new clothes
But lately I ve seen her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
Queen Mary she s my friend
Yes I believe I ll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
Baby can t be blessed
Till she finally sees that
She s like all the rest
With her fog her amphetamines and her pearls
Well it was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your longtime curse hurts
But what s worse
Is are this pain here
I can t stay here
Baby
Ain t it clear that
I just can t fit
I believe it s time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don t you let on
That you knew me when
I was hungry and
It was your world
Spirit on the water
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking about you baby
I can t hardly sleep
I m traveling by land
Traveling through the dawn of day
You re always on my mind
I can t stay away
I d forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
That we were meant to be more than friends
When you are near
It s just as plain as it can be
I m wild about you gal
You ought to be a fool about me
Can t explain
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart
You got the key to my brain
I ve been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I m sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love
Life without you
Doesn t mean a thing to me
If I can t have you
I ll throw my love into the deep blue sea
Sometimes I wonder
Why you can t treat me right
You do good all day
Then you do wrong all night
When you re with me
I m a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter
What price I pay
They brag about your sugar
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down
I m pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost No
But you have heard of them
I see you there
I m blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me
I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I m saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind
Your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can t believe these things would ever fade from your mind
I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don t ever
Have to make a fuss over me
From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can
I been in a brawl
Now I m feeling the wall
I m going away baby
I won t be back till fall
High on the hill
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You ve numbed my will
This love could tear me in two
I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can t go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there
You think I m over the hill
You think I m past my prime
Let me see what you got
We can have a whoppin  good time
They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
And how I know I ll make it through
And they they look at me and frown
They d like to drive me from this town
They don t want me around
Because I believe in you
They they show me to the door
They say Don t come back no more
 Cause I don t be like they d like me to
And I I walk out on my own
A thousand miles from home
But I don t feel alone
Because I believe in you
Don t let me drift too far
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed
And that which you ve given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you
Don t let me change my heart
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue
And I I don t mind the pain
Don t mind the driving rain
I know I will sustain
Because I believe in you
You will search babe
At any cost
But how long babe
Can you search for what is not lost
Everybody will help you
Some people are very kind
But if I can save you any time
Come on give it to me
I ll keep it with mine
I can t help it
If you might think I am odd
If I say I m loving you not for what you are
But for what you re not
Everybody will help you
Discover what you set out to find
But if I can save you any time
Come on give it to me
I ll keep it with mine
The train leaves
At half past ten
But it will be back
In the same old spot again
The conductor
He s still stuck on the line
And if I can save you any time
Come on give it to me
Ill keep it with mine
One more night the stars are in sight
But tonight Im as lonesome as can be
Oh the moon is shinin  bright
Lighting everything in sight
But tonight no light will shine on me
Oh its shameful and its sad I lost the only pal I had
I just could not be what she wanted me to be
I will turn my head up high
To that dark and rollin  sky
For tonight no light will shine on me
One more night I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree
Oh I miss my darlin  so
I didnt mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me
One more night the moon is shinin  bright
And the wind blows high above the tree
Oh I miss that woman so
I didnt mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me
In the still of the night in the world s ancient light
Where wisdom grows up in strife
My bewildering brain toils in vain
Through the darkness on the pathways of life
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
Tomorrow keeps turning around
We live and we die we know not why
But I ll be with you when the deal goes down
We eat and we drink we feel and we think
Far down the street we stray
I laugh and I cry and I m haunted by
Things I never meant nor wished to say
The midnight rain follows the train
We all wear the same thorny crown
Soul to soul our shadows roll
And I ll be with you when the deal goes down
The moon gives light and shines by night
I scarcely feel the glow
We learn to live and then we forgive
O er the road we re bound to go
More frailer than the flowers these precious hours
That keep us so tightly bound
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And I ll be with you when the deal goes down
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
I followed the winding stream
I heard a deafening noise I felt transient joys
I know they re not what they seem
In this earthly domain full of disappointment and pain
You ll never see me frown
I owe my heart to you and that s saying  it true
And I ll be with you when the deal goes down
Oh Shenandoah I long to hear you
Look away you rolling river
Oh Shenandoah I long to hear you
Look away We re bound away
Across the wide Missouri
Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away you rolling river
Indians camp along her border
Look away We re bound away
Across the wide Missouri
Well a white man loved an Indian maiden
Look away you rolling river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away we re bound away
Across the wide Missouri
Oh Shenandoah I love your daughter
Look away you rolling river
It was for her I d cross the water
Look away we re bound away
Across the wide Missouri
For seven long years I courted Sally
Look away you rolling river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away we re bound away
Across the wide Missouri
Well it s faretheewell my dear
I m bound to leave you
Look away you rolling river
Shenandoah I will not deceive you
Look away we re bound away
Across the wide Missouri
Here comes Santa Claus here comes Santa Claus

What good am I if Im like all the rest
If I just turn away when I see how youre dressed
If I shut myself off so I cant hear you cry
What good am I
What good am I if I know and dont do
If I see and dont say if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky
What good am I
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who dont try
What good am I
What good am I then to others and me
If Ive had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been
What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I
He saw an animal that liked to growl
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Great big furry back and furry hair
Ah think Ill call it a bear
He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
He saw milk coming out but he didnt know how
Ah think Ill call it a cow
He saw an animal that liked to snort
Horns on his head and they werent too short
It looked like there wasnt nothing that he couldnt pull
Ah think Ill call it a bull
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
Real dirty face and a curly tail
He wasnt too small and he wasnt too big
Ah think Ill call it a pig
Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
Ah think Ill call it a sheep
You put your hand on your head Hand on your head
Put your foot in the air Foot in the air
Then you hop around the room Hop around the room
In your underwear In your underwear
There ain t never been nothing quite like this
Come on baby it s The Wilbury Twist
Lift your other foot up Other foot up
And fall on your ass Fall on your ass
Get back up Get back up
Put your teeth in a glass Teeth in a glass
Ain t never been nothing quite like this
It s a magical thing called The Wilbury Twist
Roll up your rug Roll up your rug
Dust your broom Dust your broom
Ball the jack Ball the jack
Howl at the moon At the moon
Ain t ever been nothing quite like this
Everybody s talking  bout The Wilbury Twist
Turn your lights down low Your lights down low
Put your blindfold on Your blindfold on
You ll never know You ll never know
When your friends have gone When your friends have gone
It could be years before you re missed
Everybody s trying to do The Wilbury Twist
It s a different dance Different dance
For you all to do For you all to do
Spin your body Very versatile
Like a screw Spin your body like a screw
Better not forget it on your shopping list
You can stop and buy one it s The Wilbury Twist
And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper Please adore me
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold
Blue moon now I m no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Gone walk down that dirt road til someone lets me ride
Gone walk down that dirt road til someone lets me ride
If I cant find my baby Im gonna run away and hide
I have been pacing around the room hoping maybe shed come back
Pacing around the room hoping maybe shed come back
Well I have been praying for salvation laying round in a oneroom country shack
Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Till theres nothing left to see tell the chains have been shattered
And Ive been freed
I been looking at my shadow I have been watching the colors up above
Looking at my shadow watching the colors up above
Rolling through the rain and hail looking for the sunny side of love
Gonna walk down that dirt road  til everything becomes the same
Gonna walk down that dirt road  til everything becomes the same
I keep on walking  til I hear her holler out my name
Cant you hear that rooster crowing
Rabbit running down across the road
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning new morning
On this new morning with you
Cant you hear that motor turning
Automobile coming into style
Coming down the road for a country mile or two
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning new morning
On this new morning with you
Cant you feel that sun ashining
Ground hog running by the country stream
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning new morning
On this new morning with you
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning new morning
On this new morning with you
New morning
This morning I looked out my window and found
A bluebird singing but there was no one around
At night I lay alone in my bed
With an image of you goin  around in my head
I guess I must have loved you more than I ever knew
My world is empty now  cause it don t have you
And if I had just one more chance to win your heart again
I would do things differently but what s the use to pretend
I woke in the mornin  wandering
Weary and worn out
I woke in the morning wandering
Weary and worn out
Wishin my longlost lover
Would walk to me and talk to me
Tell me what its all about
I was standin at the side road
Listenin to the billboard knock
Standin  at the side road
Listenin to the billboard knock
Well my wrist was empty
But my nerves were kickin
Tickin like a clock
Well I got anything you need babe
Let me tell you in front
If I got anything you need babe
Let me tell you in front
You can come to me sometime
Night time day time
Any time you want
Sometimes Im thinkin  Im
Too high to fall
Sometimes Im thinkin  Im
Much too high to fall
Other times Im thinkin  Im
So low I dont know
If I can come up at all
Black crows in the meadow
Sleepin  across a broad highway
Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway
Though its funny honey
I m outta  touch dont feel much like a
Scarecrow today
Oh help me in my weakness
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away
My trip hasnt been a pleasant one
And my time it isnt long
And I still do not know
What it was that Ive done wrong
Well the judge he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
You fail to understand he said
Why must you even try
Outside the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more
Oh stop that cursed jury
Cried the attendant and the nurse
The trial was bad enough
But this is ten times worse
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape
And while evrybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape
Feeling funny in my mind Lord
I believe I m fixing to die fixing to die
Feeling funny in my mind Lord
I believe I m fixing to die
Well I don t mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
Well I look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome Lord when the sun goes down
Feeling funny in my eyes Lord
I believe I m fixing to die fixing to die
Feeling funny in my eyes Lord
I believe I m fixing to die
Well I don t mind dying but
I hate to leave my children crying
There s a black smoke rising Lord
It s rising up above my head up above my head
It s rising up above my head up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed
I m walking kind of funny Lord
I believe I m fixing to die fixing to die
Yes I m walking kind of funny Lord
I believe I m fixing to die
Fixing to die fixing to die
Well I don t mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
Oh the benches were stained with tears and perspiration
The birdies were flying from tree to tree
There was little to say there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree
And the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah the locusts sang and they were singing for me
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking
Darkness was everywhere it smelled like a tomb
I was ready to leave I was already walking
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the locusts sang yeah it give me a chill
Oh the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh the locusts sang their high whining trill
Yeah the locusts sang and they were singing for me
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading
The weather was hot anearly  degrees
The man standing next to me his head was exploding
Well I was praying the pieces wouldnt fall on me
Yeah the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh the locusts sang off in the distance
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me
I put down my robe picked up my diploma
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Straight for the hills the black hills of Dakota
Sure was glad to get out of there alive
And the locusts sang well it give me a chill
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody
And the locusts sang with a high whining trill
Yeah the locusts sang and they was singing for me
Singing for me well singing for me
There s guns across the river about to pound you
There s a lawman on your trail like to surround you
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you
Billy they don t like you to be so free
Camping out all night on the veranda
Walking in the streets down by the hacienda
Up to Boot Hill the like to send you
Billy don t you turn your back on me
There s mills inside the minds of crazy faces
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases
There is always one more notch in four more aces
Billy and you re playing all alone
Playing around with some sweet signorita
Into her dark chamber she will greet you
In the shadows of the maizes she will lead you
Billy and you re going all alone
They say that Pat Garrett s got your number
So sleep with one eye open when you wander
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun
There s always another stranger sneaking glances
Some triggerhappy fool willing to take chances
Some old whore from San Pedro ll make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
So they ve hired mister Garrett he ll force you to slow down
Billy don t let it make you feel so low down
To be hunted by the man who was your friend
So hang on to your woman if you got one
Remember in El Paso once you shot one
I ll be in Santa Fe about one
Billy you ve been running for so long
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Way down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley
Billy you re so far away from home
Billy you re so far away from home
There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak but only flatter
He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there he made his bed
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
The soles of my feet I swear theyre burning
Oh the leaves began to falling
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told but these few words
Which opened up his heart
If ye cannot bring good news then dont bring any
Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt
Ive been burned before and I know the score
So you wont hear me complain
Will I be able to count on you
Or is your love in vain
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude
When I am in the darkness why do you intrude
Do you know my world do you know my kind
Or must I explain
Will you let me be myself
Or is your love in vain
All right Ill take a chance I will fall in love with you
If Im a fool you can have the night you can have the morning too
Can you cook and sew make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain
Can you cook and sew make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain
Well God said to Abraham Kill me a son
Abe said Man you must be putting me on
God said No
Abe said What
God said You do what you want to Abe but
The next time you see me coming you d better run
Abe said Where do you want this killing done
God said Out on that Highway
Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare department would give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard Where can I go
Howard said There s only one place I know
Sam said Quick man tell me I got to run
Howard just pointed with his gun
He said that way down on
Well Mack the finger said Louie the King
I got  red white and blue shoe strings
And a thousand telephones that won t ring
You know where I can get rid of these things
And he said Now let me think for a minute son
Said Yes that can be easily done
Just take them down on that
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren t right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said Come here and stare up into the light
And said Mmm you re right
Let me tell the second mother it s been done
But the second mother with the seventh son
They were out on that highway
Now the roving gambler was very bored
Trying to create the next world war
And he found a promoter fell on the floor
And said I ve never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yep I think it can be easily done
Highway
We ll just put some bleachers there out in the sun
Have it out on that
Look out your window baby theres a scene youd like to catch
The band is playing Dixie a man got his hand outstretched
Could be the Fhrer
Could be the local priest
You know sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
He got a sweet gift of gab he got a harmonious tongue
He knows every song of love that ever has been sung
Good intentions can be evil
Both hands can be full of grease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well first hes in the background then hes in the front
Both eyes are looking like theyre on a rabbit hunt
Nobody can see through him
No not even the Chief of Police
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well he catch you when youre hoping for a glimpse of the sun
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
He could be standing next to you
The person that youd notice least
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well he can be fascinating he can be dull
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull
I can smell something cooking
I can tell theres going to be a feast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Hes a great humanitarian hes a great philanthropist
He knows just where to touch you honey and how you like to be kissed
Hell put both his arms around you
You can feel the tender touch of the beast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well the howling wolf will howl tonight the king snake will crawl
Trees thatve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall
Want to get married Do it now
Tomorrow all activity will cease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Somewhere Mamas weeping for her blueeyed boy
Shes holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
And hes following a star
The same one them three men followed from the East
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
My wretched heart s pounding
I felt an angel s kiss
My memories are drowning
In mortal bliss
Beyond the horizon in the Springtime or Fall
Love waits forever for one and for all
Beyond the horizon across the divide
 Round about midnight we ll be on the same side
Down in the valley the water runs cold
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul
I m touched with desire
What don t I do
I ll throw the logs on the fire
I ll build my world around you
Beyond the horizon at the end of the game
Every step that you take I m walking the same
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow
The theme of a melody from many moons ago
The bells of St Mary how sweetly they chime
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time
It s dark and it s dreary
I ponder in vain
I m weakened I m weary
My repentance is plain
Beyond the horizon o er the treacherous sea
I still can t believe that you ve set aside your love for me
Beyond the horizon  neath crimson skies
In the soft light of morning I ll follow you with my eyes
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone
It s late in the season
Never knew never cared
Whatever the reason
Someone s life has been spared
Just a minute  fore you leave girl
Just a minute  fore you touch the door
What is it that youre trying to achieve girl
Do you think we can talk about it some more
You know the streets are filled with vipers
Whove lost all ray of hope
You know it s not even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope
Come over here from over there girl
Sit down here you can have my chair
I cant see us goin  anywhere girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away
And I cant take you there
I wished Id have been a doctor
Maybe Id have saved some life that ve been lost
Maybe Id have done some good in the world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed
I ain t too good at conversation girl
So you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could Id bring you to the mountain top girl
And build you a house made out of stainless steel
But its like Im stuck inside a painting
Thats ahanging in the Louvre
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I cant move
Lets try to get beneath the surface waste girl
No more booby traps and bombs
No more decadence and charms
No more affection thats misplaced girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
What about that millionaire
With the drumsticks in his pants
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didnt dance
It am not that Im questioning you
To take part in any quiz
Its just that I have got no watch
And you keep asking me what time it is
I am just a poor boy baby
Looking to connect
But I certainly dont want you thinking
That I have not got any respect
You know Id have nightmares
And a guilty conscience too
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do
It ain t that Im wanting
Anything you never gave before
Its just that Ill be sleeping soon
Itll be too dark for you to find the door
In death you face life with a child and a wife
Who sleepwalks through your dreams into walls
Youre a soldier of mercy youre cold and you curse
He who cannot be trusted must fall
Loneliness tenderness high society notoriety
You fight for the throne and you travel alone
Unknown as you slowly sink
And theres no time to think
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity
In secret for pieces of change
The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
And it makes you feel violent and strange
Memory ecstasy tyranny hypocrisy
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
In the valley of the missing link
And you have no time to think
Judges will haunt you the country priestess will want you
Her worst is better than best
Ive seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
And I feel so depressed
China doll alcohol duality mortality
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
Like the plague with a dangerous wink
And theres no time to think
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
Where the lion lies down with the lamb
Id have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
But thats just the way that I am
Paradise sacrifice mortality reality
But the magician is quicker and his game
Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
And theres no time to think
Anger and jealousys all that he sells us
Hes content when youre under his thumb
Madmen oppose him but your kindness throws him
To survive it you play deaf and dumb
Equality liberty humility simplicity
You glance through the mirror and theres eyes staring clear
At the back of your head as you drink
And theres no time to think
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
Will offer their heads for a prayer
You cant find no salvation you have no expectations
Anytime anyplace anywhere
Mercury gravity nobility humility
You know you cant keep her and the water gets deeper
That is leading you onto the brink
But theres no time to think
Youve murdered your vanity buried your sanity
For pleasure you must now resist
Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
Theyre not even sure you exist
Socialism hypnotism patriotism materialism
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
And the sound of the keys as they clink
But theres no time to think
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
With the rose in her hair
Starlight in the East and youre finally released
Youre stranded but with nothing to share
Loyalty unity epitome rigidity
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
Neath the moon shining bloody and pink
And theres no time to think
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
But no you will not be deceived
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt
You can give but you cannot receive
No time to choose when the truth must die
No time to lose or say goodbye
No time to prepare for the victim thats there
No time to suffer or blink
And no time to think
Well my shoes they come from Singapore
My flashlights from Taiwan
My tablecloths from Malaysia
My belt buckles from the Amazon
You know this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet
It was put together down in Argentina
By a guy making thirty cents a day
Well this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the pearls are from Japan
Well the dog collars from India
And the flower pots from Pakistan
All the furniture it says Made in Brazil
Where a woman she slaved for sure
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve
You know thats a lot of money to her
Well you know lots of people complaining that there is no work
I say Why you say that for
When nothing you got is U S made
They dont make nothin here no more
You know capitalism is above the law
It say It dont count less it sells
When it costs too much to build it at home
You just build it cheaper someplace else
Well the job that you used to have
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador
The unions are big business friend
And theyre going out like a dinosaur
They used to grow food in Kansas
Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Is going to be against the law
Democracy dont rule the world
Youd better get that in your head
This world is ruled by violence
But I guess thats better left unsaid
From Broadway to the Milky Way
Thats a lot of territory indeed
And a mans going to do what he has to do
When hes got a hungry mouth to feed
In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
Youre coming thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams
Youre blowing down the shaky street
Youre hearing my heart beat
In the recordbreaking heat
Where we were born in time
Not one more night not one more kiss
Not this time baby no more of this
Takes too much skill takes too much will
Its revealing
You came you saw just like the law
You married young just like your ma
You tried and tried you made me slide
You left me reeling with this feeling
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You wont get anything you dont deserve
Where we were born in time
You pressed me once you pressed me twice
You hang the flame youll pay the price
Oh babe that fire
Is still smoking
You were snow you were rain
You were striped you were plain
Oh babe truer words
Have not been spoken or broken
In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have whats left of me
Where we were born in time
When youre sad and when youre lonely
And you havent got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that youve held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
When youre standing at the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you dont know whats up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
When the storm clouds gather round you
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And theres no one there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
And you search in vain to find
Just one lawabiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
On a night like this
So glad you came around
Hold on to me so tight
And heat up some coffee grounds
We got much to talk about
And much to reminisce
It sure is right
On a night like this
On a night like this
So glad youve come to stay
Hold on to me pretty miss
Say youll never go away to stray
Run your fingers down my spine
Bring me a touch of bliss
It sure feels right
On a night like this
On a night like this
I cant get any sleep
The air is so cold outside
And the snows so deep
Build a fire throw on logs
And listen to it hiss
And let it burn burn burn burn
On a night like this
Put your body next to mine
And keep me company
There is plenty aroom for all
So please dont elbow me
Let the four winds blow
Around this old cabin door
If Im not too far off
I think we did this once before
Theres more frost on the window glass
With each new tender kiss
But it sure feels right
On a night like this
Clouds so swift the rain s pourin  in
We re gonna see a movie called Gunga Din
Pack up your money put up your tent McGuinn
You ain t goin  nowhere
Well Genghis Khan and his brother Don
They could not keep from keepin  on
We ll cross that bridge after it s gone
After we have passed it yeah
Diamonds and rings and a gun that sings
A flute that toots and a bee that stings
A sky that cried and a bird that flies
A fish that walks and a dog that talks
Man comes to the doorI say For whom are you looking
He says Your wife I say Shes busy in the kitchen cooking
Poor boywhere you been
I already told youwont tell you again
I say How much you want for that I go into the store
The man says Three dollars All right I say Will you take four
Poor boynever say die
Things will be all right by and by
Been working on the mainlineworking like the devil
The game is the sameits just on a different level
Poor boydressed in black
Police at your back
Poor boy in a red hot town
Out beyond the twinkling stars
Riding firstclass trainsmaking the rounds
Trying to keep from falling between the cars
Othello told Desdemona Im cold cover me with a blanket
By the way what happened to that poison wine
She says I gave it to you you drank it
Poor boy laying them straightpicking up the cherries falling off the plate
Time and love has branded me with its claws
Had to go to Florida dodging them Georgia laws
Poor boy in the hotel called the Palace of Gloom
Calls down to room service says send up a room
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer
My father was a traveling salesman I never met him
When my mother died my uncle took me inhe ran a funeral parlor
He did a lot of nice things for me and I wont forget him
All I know is that Im thrilled by your kiss
I dont know any more than this
Poor boy picking up sticks
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks
Knocking on the door I say Who is it and where are you from
Man says Freddy I say Freddy who He says Freddy or not here I come
Poor boy beneath the stars that shine
Washing them dishes feeding them swine
I am a lonesome hobo
Without family or friends
Where another mans life might begin
Thats exactly where mine ends
I have tried my hand at bribery
Blackmail and deceit
And Ive served time for everything
Cept beggin  on the street
Well once I was rather prosperous
There was nothing I did lack
I had fourteenkarat gold in my mouth
And silk upon my back
But I did not trust my brother
I carried him to blame
Which led me to my fatal doom
To wander off in shame
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen
Soon I will be gone
But let me just warn you all
Before I do pass on
Stay free from petty jealousies
Live by no mans code
And hold your judgment for yourself
Lest you wind up on this road
Not I says the referee
Dont point your finger at me
I couldve stopped it in the eighth
And maybe kept him from his fate
But the crowd wouldve booed Im sure
At not getting their moneys worth
Its too bad he had to go
But there was a pressure on me too you know
It wasnt me that made him fall
No you cant blame me at all
Not us says the angry crowd
Whose screams filled the arena loud
Its too bad he died that night
But we just like to see a fight
We didnt mean for him to meet his death
We just meant to see some sweat
There is nothing wrong in that
It wasnt us that made him fall
No you cant blame us at all
Not me says his manager
Puffing on a big cigar
Its hard to say its hard to tell
I always thought that he was well
Its too bad for his wife an kids hes dead
But if he was sick he shouldve said
It wasnt me that made him fall
No you cant blame me at all
Not me says the gambling man
With his ticket stub still in his hand
It wasnt me that knocked him down
My hands never touched him none
I didnt commit no ugly sin
Anyway I put money on him to win
It wasnt me that made him fall
No you cant blame me at all
Not me says the boxing writer
Pounding print on his old typewriter
Saying Boxing is not to blame
Theres just as much danger in a football game
Saying Fist fighting is here to stay
Its just the old American way
It wasnt me that made him fall
No you cant blame me at all
Not me says the man whose fists
Laid him low in a cloud of mist
Who came here from Cubas door
Where boxing is not allowed no more
I hit him yes its true
But thats what I am paid to do
Dont say murder dont say kill
It was destiny it was Gods will
Well as we marched down as we marched down
Well as we marched down to Fennerio
Well our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
Her name that she had was Pretty PeggyO
Well what will your mother say what will your mother say
What will your mother say Pretty PeggyO
What will your mother say to know you re going away
You re never never never coming backio
Come arunning down your stairs

Combing back your yellow hair

Oh yeah well
I get rattled every time we meet
I get rattled even in my sleep
Yeah
I get twisted I get turned around
I get twisted and I m up and I m down
Whoa I get shaken I get torn up by the roots
Yeah I m shakin  way down in my boots
Broke my heart lost my soul
Adios mi corazon
Spanish is the loving tongue
Soft as music light as spring
It was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
Well I don t look much like a lover
Still I say her love words over
Mostly when I m all alone
Mi amor mi Cora sole
Haven t seen her since that night
I can t cross the line you know
They want me for a gambling fight
Like as not it s better so
Still I always kind of missed her
Since that last sad night I kissed her
Broke her heart lost my own
Adios mi Corazon
Broke her heart lost my own
Adios mi Corazon
Adios mi Corazon
Adios mi Corazon
Old Reilly stole a stallion
But they caught him and they brought him back
And they laid him down on the Jailhouse ground
With an iron chain around his neck
Old Reillys daughter got a message
That her father was going to hang
She rode by night and came by morning
With gold and silver in her hand
When the judge he saw Reillys daughter
His old eyes deepened in his head
Saying Gold will never free your father
The price my dear is you instead
Oh Im as good as dead cried Reilly
Its only you that he does crave
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all
Get on your horse and ride away
Oh father you will surely die
If I dont take the chance to try
And pay the price and not take your advice
For that reason I will have to stay
The gallows shadows shook the evening
In the night a hound dog bayed
In the night the grounds were groaning
In the night the price was paid
The next morning she had awoken
To know that the judge had never spoken
She saw that hangin branch abendin
She saw her fathers body broken
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel
That one doctor will not save him
That two healers will not heal him
That three eyes will not see him
That four ears will not hear him
That five walls will not hide him
That six diggers will not bury him
And that seven deaths shall never kill him
God dont make no promises that He dont keep
You got some big dreams baby but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep
Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat and Henry Kissingers got you tied up in knots
You got innocent men in jail your insane asylums are filled
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs thatll never cure your ills
You got men who cant hold their peace and women who cant control their tongues
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young
Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules
Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved
Do you ever wonder just what God requires
You think Hes just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires
You cant take it with you and you know that its too worthless to be sold
They tell you Time is money as if your life was worth its weight in gold
Theres a Man up on a cross and Hes been crucified for you
Beleive in  His power it s all about you got to do
Mama take this badge off of me
I cant use it anymore
Its getting dark too dark to see
I feel Im knockin  on heavens door
Mama put my guns in the ground
I cant shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is comin  down
I feel like Im knockin  on heavens door
I had a pony her name was Lucifer
I had a pony her name was Lucifer
She broke her leg and needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her
Sometimes I wonder whats going on with Miss X
Sometimes I wonder whats going on with Miss X
She got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the poor girls gonna do to me next
I got a new pony she knows how to foxtrot lope and pace
Well I got a new pony she knows how to foxtrot lope and pace
She got great big hind legs long black shaggy hair hanging in her face
Everybody says youre using voodoo I ve seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh well everybody says youre using voodoo I ve seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh baby that god you been prayin to
Gonna given you back what youre wishing on someone else
Come over here pony Ihi want to climb up on top on you well
Come over here pony I wanna climb up one time on you
Youre oh so nasty and so bad  I swear I love you yes I do
I rolled and I tumbled I cried the whole night long
I rolled and I tumbled I cried the whole night long
Woke up this morning  I must have bet my money wrong
I got troubles so hard I can t stand the strain
I got troubles so hard I just can t stand the strain
Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains
The landscape is glowing  gleaming  in the golden light of day
The landscape is glowing  gleaming  in the gold light of day
I am not holding nothing  back now I am not standing  in anybody s way
Well I did all I know just to keep you off my mind
Well I did all I know just to keep you off my mind
Well I paid and I paid and my suffering  heart is always on the line
Well I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade
I get up in the dawn and I go down and lay in the shade
I ain t nobody s house boy I ain t nobody s well trained maid
I m flatout spent this woman has been driving  me to tears
I m flatout spent this woman she has been driving  me to tears
This woman so crazy I swear I ain t gonna touch another one for years
Well the warm weather is coming  and the buds are on the vine
The warm weather s comin  the buds are on the vine
Ain t nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine
I got up this morning  saw the rising sun return
Well I got up this morning  seen the rising sun return
Sooner or later you too shall burn
The night s filled with shadows the years are filled with early doom
The night s filled with shadows the years are filled with early doom
I ve been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumbling  tombs
Let s forgive each other darling  let s go down to the greenwood glen
Let s forgive each other darling  let s go down to the greenwood glen
Let s put our heads together let s put old matters to an end
Now I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long
Ah I rolled and I tumbled I cried the whole night long
I woke up this morning I think I must be traveling  wrong
Theres a longdistance train rolling through the rain
Tears on the letter I write
Theres a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much
But shes drifting like a satellite
Theres a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze
Laughter down on Elizabeth Street
And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat
Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise
But he practiced what he preached from the heart
A fullblooded Cherokee he predicted it to me
The time and the place that we d part
Theres a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And a longtime goldenhaired stripper onstage
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
Of a book that no one can write
Oh where are you tonight
The truth was obscure too profound and too pure
To live it you had to explode
In that last hour of need we entirely agreed
Sacrifice was the code of the road
I left town at dawn with Marcel and St John
Strong men belittled by doubt
I couldnt tell her what my private thoughts were
But she had some way of finding them out
He took deadcenter aim but he missed just the same
She was waiting putting flowers on the shelf
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
And discovered her invisible self
Theres a lion in the road theres a demon escaped
Theres a million dreams gone theres a landscape being raped
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape
I wont but then again maybe I might
Oh if I could just find you tonight
I fought with my twin that enemy within
Til both of us fell by the way
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
While the law looks the other way
Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
The man you were lovin could never get clean
It felt out of place my foot in his face
But he shoulda stayed where his money was green
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
With the juice running down my leg
Then I dealt with your boss whod never known about loss
Who always was too proud to beg
Theres a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And a pathway that leads up to the stars
If you dont believe theres a price for this sweet paradise
Just remind me to show you the scars
Theres a new day at dawn and Ive finally arrived
If Im there in the morning baby youll know Ive survived
I cant believe it I cant believe Im alive
But without you it just doesnt seem right
Oh where are you tonight
I was blinded by the devil
Born already ruined
Stonecold dead
As I stepped out of the womb
By His grace I have been touched
By His word I have been healed
By His hand Ive been delivered
By His spirit Ive been sealed
By His truth I can be upright
By His strength I do endure
By His power Ive been lifted
In His love I am secure
He bought me with a price
Freed me from the pit
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it
Nobody to rescue me
Nobody would dare
I was going down for the last time
But by His mercy Ive been spared
Not by works
But by faith in Him who called
For so long Ive been hindered
For so long Ive been stalled
Come you ladies and you gentlemen alisten to my song
Sing it to you right but you might think its wrong
Just a little glimpse of a story Ill tell
Bout an East Coast city that you all know well
Its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town
Old New York City is a friendly old town
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down
Theres amighty many people all milling all around
Theyll kick you when youre up and knock you when youre down
Its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town
Well the weekend is strong and the rich and the poor
Get there together in roof an  no more
Crowdin  up  bove and crowdin  down below
And someone disappears you never even know
And it s hard times from the country livin  down in New York town
Its a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
To Rockefeller Plaza n the Empire State
Mister Empire sets up as high as a bird
Old Mister Rockefeller never says a word
Its hard times from the country
Living down in New York town
Well its up in the morning trying to find a job of work
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt
If you got a lot o money you can make yourself merry
If you only got a nickel its the Staten Island Ferry
And its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town
Mister Hudson come asailing down the stream
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream
Bought your city on a oneway track
F I had my way Id sell it right back
And its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town
Ill take all the smog in Californeay
N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines
Its all much cleaner than the New York kind
And its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town
So all you newsy people spread the news around
You can listen to m story listen to m song
You can step on my name you can try n get me beat
When I leave New York Ill be standing on my feet
And its hard times in the city
Living down in New York town
Mary wore three links of chain
Every link was Jesus name
Keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
Mary Mark Luke and John
All these prophets so good and gone
Keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
Well I never been to heaven
But I ve been told streets up there
Are lined with gold
Keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
Oh Lord Oh Lord keep your hand on that plow hold on
Far away where the soft winds blow
Far away from it all
There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall
Far away in the stormy night
Far away and over the wall
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall
We banged the drum slowly
And played the fife lowly
You know the song in my heart
In the turning of twilight
In the shadows of moonlight
You can show me a new place to start
Ive torn my clothes and Ive drained the cup
Stripping away at it all
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall
By rivers of blindness
In love and with kindness
We could hold up a toast if we meet
To the cutting of fences
To sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat
Roses are red violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl
I just might have to come see you
Where teardrops fall
I got a heavyheaded gal
I got a heavyheaded gal
I got a heavyheaded gal
She aint afeelin well
When shes better only time will tell
My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
My money comes and goes
And rolls and flows and rolls and flows
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes
I see the morning light
I see the morning light
Well its not because
Im an early riser
I didnt go to sleep last night
I got my walking shoes
I got my walking shoes
I got my walking shoes
An I aint agonna lose
I believe I got the walking blues
I was born in Dixie in a boomer shed
Just a little shanty by the railroad track
Freight train was it taught me how to cry
The holler of the driver was my lullaby
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go baby don t you know
Well it looks like I m never going to lose the freight train blues
Well my daddy was a fireman and my mamaha
She was the only daughter of an engineer
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain t no joke
Seems a waste to get a good man broke
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go mama don t you know
Well it looks like I m never going to lose the freight train blues
Well the only thing that makes me laugh again
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
Every place I want to go I never can go
Because you know I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
Time passes slowly up here in the mountains
We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream
Time passes slowly when youre lost in a dream
Once I had a sweetheart she was fine and goodlooking
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking
Stared out the window to the stars high above
Time passes slowly when youre searching for love
Time passes slowly up here in the daylight
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Time passes slowly and fades away
Im a rambler Im a gambler
Im a long way from my home
If the people dont like me
They can leave me alone
Come sit down beside me
Come sit down right here
Come sit down love I want you
Love you boldly so dear
When you get to Wyoming
A letter youll see
If you get into trouble
Just you write and tell me
For I once had a lover
Her age was sixteen
Shes a flower of velvet and the rose of Celine
Her parents was against me
Now she is the same
If I write on your book love
Just you blot out my name
I m old Tom Moore from the bummer s shore in that good old golden days
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too but what cares I for praise
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And all the people say There goes Tom Moore in the days of
My comrades they all loved me well a jolly saucy crew
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch they never would fret or whine
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of
There was New York Jake the butcher boy he was always getting tight
And every time that he d get full he was spoiling for a fight
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of
There was Poker Bill one of the boys who was always in a game
Whether he lost or whether he won to him it was always the same
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind
In the game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget
He would roar all day and he d roar all night and I guess he s roaring yet
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring bad design
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of
Of the comrades all that I ve had there s none that s left to boast
And I m left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost
And I pass by from town to town they call me a rambling sign
There goes Tom Moore a bummer shore in the days of
Change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Gonna change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Going to put my good foot forward
Stop being influenced by fools
So much oppression
Can t keep track of it no more
So much oppression
Can t keep track of it no more
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers
Old men turning young daughters into whores
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Swords piercing your side
Blood and water flowing through the land
Well I don t know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
Don t know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or being cool
You remember only about the brass ring
You forget all about the golden rule
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
But there s only one authority
And that s the authority on high
I got a Godfearing woman
One I can easily afford

One I can easily afford
She can do the Georgia Crawl
She can walk in the Spirit of the Lord
Jesus said Be ready
For you know not the hour in which I come
Jesus said Be ready
For you know not the hour in which I come
He said He who is not for Me is against Me
Just so you know where He s coming from
There s a kingdom called Heaven
A place where there is no pain of birth
There s a place called Heaven

Jesus is calling Hes coming back to gather up his jewels

Im stepping out of the dark woods Im jumping on the monkeys back
Im all dressed up Im going to the county dance

Every day you got to pray for guidance
Every day you got to give yourself a chance
Storms are on the ocean storms out on the mountain too
Storms are on the ocean storms out on the mountain too
Oh Lord you know I have no friend like you
Ill tell you something things you never had youll never miss
Ill tell you something things you never had youll never miss
A brave man will kill you with a sword a coward with a kiss
No more driver s lash for me
No more no more
No more driver s lash for me
Many thousands gone
No more whip lash for me
No more no more
No more pint of salt for me
Many thousands gone
Ive seen love go by my door
Its never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
Shooting in the dark too long
When somethings not right its wrong
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Dragon clouds so high above
I ve only known careless love
It s always hit me from below
But this time around it is more correct
Right on target so direct
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Purple clover Queen Anne s lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry if you don t know
Can t remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoiling me with too much love
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine have been like Verlaine s and Rimbaud
But there s no way I can compare
All those scenes to this affair
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
You re gonna make me wonder what I m doing
Staying far behind without you
You re gonna make me wonder what I m saying
Make me give myself a good talkingto
I ll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco Ashtabula
You re gonna have to leave me now I know
I ll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass in the ones I love
You re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Oh you re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Oh you re gonna make me lonesome when you go
Johnny s in the basement mixing up the medicine
I m on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat badge out laid off
Says he s got a bad cough wants to get it paid off
God knows when but you re doing  it again
You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills you only got ten
Maggie comes fleet foot face full of black soot
Talking at the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone s tapped anyway Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early may
Orders from the DA the double DA
Walk on your tip toes don t try no doz
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose watch the plain clothes
You don t need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Looks to me like you did
A little to much hitting  kid
You should ve took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid
Get sick get well hand around a ink well
Ring a bell hard to tell if anything is going to sell
Try hard get barred get back write braille
Get jailed jump bail join the army if you fail
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy
Told about Jesus told about the rain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
By a man who had been dying and disappeared so mysteriously
Was she a child or an angel Did we go too far
Were we sniper bait Did we follow a star
To a hole in the wall wall to where the long arm of the law can not reach
Could I been used and played as a pawn
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore
She said We got a mutual friend over by the door
And you know hes got our best interest in mind
He was well connected but her heart was a snare
And she had left him to die in there
There were payments due and he was a little behind
The cry of the peacock flies buzz my head
Ceiling fan broken theres a heat in my bed
Street band playing Nearer My God to Thee
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
She said I know what youre thinking but there aint a thing
You can do about it so let us just agree to agree
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea
I hear a voice crying Daddy I always think its for me
But its only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
Every new messenger brings evil report
Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls
Would I have married her I dont know I suppose
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
But I kept hearing my name and had to be moving on
I saw screws break loose saw the devil pound tin
I saw a house in the country being torn from within
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire
When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast
And the name she bore was Flora the lily of the west
I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find
But she turned unto another man whose sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty deprived me of my rest
Then go my lovely Flora the lily of the west
Away down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there it seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora the lily of the west
I stepped up my rival dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar and body made him stand
Seeing mad by desperation I pierced him to the breast
All this for lovely Flora the lily of the west
I had to stand my trial I had to make my plea
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora the Lily of the west
Strange things have happened like never before
My baby told me I would have to go
I can t be good no more once like I did before
I can t be good baby
Honey because the world s gone wrong
Feel bad this morning ain t got no home
No use in worrying  cause the world gone wrong
I can t be good no more once like I did before
I can t be good baby
Honey because the world s gone wrong
I told you baby right to your head
If I didn t leave you I would have to kill you dead
I can t be good no more once like I did before
I can t be good baby
Honey because the world s gone wrong
I tried to be loving and treat you kind
But it seems like you never right you got no loyal mind
I can t be good no more once like I did before
I can t be good baby
Honey because the world s gone wrong
If you have a woman and she don t treat you kind
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind
I can t be good no more once like I did before
I can t be good baby
Honey because the world s gone wrong
Said when you been good now can t do no more
Just tell her kindly there is the front door
I can t be good no more once like I did before
I can t be good baby
Honey because the world s gone wrong
Pack up my suitcase give me my hat
No use to ask me baby  cause I ll never be back
I can t be good no more once like I did before
I can t be good baby
Honey because the world s gone wrong
How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man
How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand
How many times must those cannonballs be fired before they re forever banned
Oh yeah
Well how many years
How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea Yeah
How many years can a man exist before he s allowed to be free Yeah
Now how many times can a man turn his head and he pretends that he just doesn t see
Whoa yeah
Sometimes Im in the mood I want to leave my lonesome home
And sometimes Im in the mood I want to hear my milk cow moan
And sometimes Im in the mood I want to hit that highway road
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said
Oh babe Im in the mood for you
Sometimes Im in the mood Lord I had my overflowing fill
Sometimes Im in the mood Im going to make out my final will
Sometimes Im in the mood Im going to head for the walking hill
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said
Oh babe Im in the mood for you
Sometimes Im in the mood I want to lay right down and die
Sometimes Im in the mood I want to climb up to the sky
Sometimes Im in the mood Im going to laugh until I cry
But then again I said again I said again I said
Oh babe Im in the mood for you
Sometimes Im in the mood Im going to sleep in my ponys stall
Sometimes Im in the mood I aint going to do nothing at all
Sometimes Im in the mood I want to fly like a cannonball
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said
Oh babe Im in the mood for you
Sometimes Im in the mood I want to back up against the wall
Sometimes Im in the mood I want to run till I have to crawl
Sometimes Im in the mood I aint going to do nothing at all
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said
Oh babe Im in the mood for you
Sometimes Im in the mood I want to change my house around
Sometimes Im in the mood Im going to make a change in this here town
Sometimes Im in the mood Im going to change the world around
But then again but then again I said oh I said oh I said
Oh babe Im in the mood for you
Come baby find me come baby remind me of where I once begun
Come baby show me show me you know me tell me youre the one
I could be learning you could be yearning to see behind closed doors
But I will always be emotionally yours
Come baby rock me come baby lock me into the shadows of your heart
Come baby teach me come baby reach me let the music start
I could be dreaming but I keep believing youre the one Im living for
And I will always be emotionally yours
Its like my whole life never happened
When I see you its as if I never had a thought
I know this dream it might be crazy
But its the only one Ive got
Come baby shake me come baby take me I would be satisfied
Come baby hold me come baby help me my arms are open wide
I could be unraveling wherever Im traveling even to foreign shores
But I will always be emotionally yours
O  little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shine
An everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
How silently how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of all His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in
Amen
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I ll show them to you and you ll see them shine
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day let me see you make  em smile
Your clothes are dirty but your hands are clean
And I m the best thing that you ve ever seen
Stay lady stay stay with your man awhile
Lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay stay with your man awhile
You long to see me in the morning light
You long to reach for me in the night
I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Singing about conspiracy wanted me to be afraid
Working for a system I couldn t understand or trust
Suffered ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust
Talk about salvation people suddenly get tired
They got a million things to do they re all so inspired
You do the work of the devil you got a million friends
They ll be there when you got something they ll take it all in the end
Well the nature of man is to beg and to steal
I do it myself it s not so unreal
The call of the wild is forever at my door
Wants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor
I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray
I was told i was looking good and to have a nice day
It all seemed so proper it all seemed so elite
Eating that absolute garbage while being so discreet
You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm
While orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm
Your eyes were on fire your feet were of brass
In the world you had made they made you an outcast
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Invading my privacy making my decisions for me
Holding me back not letting me stand
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land
My Lord and my Savior my companion my friend
Heart fixer mind regulator true to the end
My creator my comforter my cause for joy
What the world is set against but will never destroy
Woke up this morning feeling blue
Seen a goodlooking girl can I make love with you
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you babe
I don t care what in the world you do
I went back home put on my tie
Going to get that girl that money that money will buy
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you babe
I don t care what in the world you do
She looked at me begin to smile
Said Hey hey man can t you wait a little while
No no babe I got blood in my eyes for you
No no babe I got blood in my eyes for you
Got blood in my eyes for you babe

Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you

You don t want me give my money back
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey hey babe I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you babe
I don t care what in the world you do
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do whats right and not be secondguessed
Dont trust me to show you beauty
When beauty may only turn to rust
If you need somebody you can trust trust yourself
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when
Dont trust me to show you the truth
When the truth may only be ashes and dust
If you want somebody you can trust trust yourself
Well youre on your own you always were
In a land of wolves and thieves
Dont put your hope in ungodly man
Or be a slave to what somebody else believes
Trust yourself
And you wont be disappointed when vain people let you down
Trust yourself
And look not for answers where no answers can be found
Dont trust me to show you love
When my love may be only lust
If you want somebody you can trust trust yourself
For his age hes wise
Hes got his mothers eyes
Theres gladness in his heart
Hes young and hes wild
My only prayer is if I cant be there
Lord protect my child
As his youth now unfolds
He is centuries old
Just to see him at play makes me smile
No matter what happens to me
No matter what my destiny
Lord protect my child
The whole world is asleep
You can look at it and weep
Few things you find are worthwhile
And though I dont ask for much
No material things to touch
Lord protect my child
Hes young and on fire
Full of hope and desire
In a world thats been raped and defiled
If I fall along the way
And cant see another day
Lord protect my child
Therell be a time I hear tell
When all will be well
When God and man will be reconciled
But until men lose their chains
And righteousness reigns
Lord protect my child
Stake my future on a hell of a past
Looks like tomorrow is coming on fast
Ain t complaining  bout what I got
Seen better times but who has not
Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
When I come knocking don t throw me no bone
I m an old boll weevil looking for a home
If you don t like it you can leave me alone
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
And charm the whistle off an evening train
I give what I got until I got no more
I take what I get until I even the score
You know I love you and furthermore
When it s time to go you got an open door
I can tell you fancy I can tell you plain
You give something up for everything you gain
Since every pleasure s got an edge of pain
Pay for your ticket and don t complain
One of these days and it won t be long
Going down in the valley and sing my song
I will sing it loud and sing it strong
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong
Twilight on the frozen lake
North wind about to break
On footprints in the snow
Silence down below
Youre beautiful beyond words
Youre beautiful to me
You can make me cry
Never say goodbye
Time is all I have to give
You can have it if you choose
With me you can live
Never say goodbye
My dreams are made of iron and steel
With a big bouquet
Of roses hanging down
From the heavens to the ground
The crashing waves roll over me
As I stand upon the sand
Wait for you to come
And grab hold of my hand
Oh baby baby baby blue
Youll change your last name too
Youve turned your hair to brown
Love to see it hanging down
There ain t no use to sit and wonder why
If in you don t know by now
There ain t no use to sit and wonder why
It ll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and i ll be gone
You re the reason I been travelin  on
So don t think twice
It s all right
There ain t no use in turnin  on your light
That light I never knowed
There ain t no use in turnin  on your light
I m on the dark side of the road
Well I wish there was somethin  you would do or say
To try and make me chance my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin  anyway
So don t think twice
It s all right
There ain t no use in callin  out my name
Like you never done before
There ain t no use in callin  out my name
I can t hear ya anymore
I m athinkin  and awond rin  walkin down the road
I once loved a woman a child i m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don t think twice it s all right
Well so long honey babe
Where i m bound I can t tell
Well goodbye s too good a word
So i ll just say fare thee well
I ain t sayin  you treated me unkind
You could ve done better but i don t mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
So don t think twice
It s all right
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
They sang Danny Boy at his funeral and the Lords Prayer
Preacher talking bout Christ betrayed
Its like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
He reached too high was thrown back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up
Sooner or later you gonna meet them coming down
Hear ya got a brother named James dont forget faces or names
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
And your fallbythe sword love affair with Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion when conformitys in fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in
Theres a retired businessman named Red
Cast down from heaven and hes out of his head
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
Hes not somebody that you play around with much
Miss Delilah is his a Philistine is what she is
Shell do wondrous works with your fate
Feed you coconut bread
Spice buns in your bed
If you dont mind sleeping with your head face down in a grave
Well theyll choose a man for you to meet tonight
Youll play the fool and learn how to walk through the doors
How to enter into the gates of paradise
No how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah from the stage theyll be trying to get water out rocks
A whore will pass the hat collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin build big universities to study in
Sing Amazing Grace all the way to the Swiss banks
They got some beautiful people out there man
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They dont believe in mercy
Judgement on them is something that youll never see
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
Turn you into anything that they want you to be
Yes I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin that hill
Did he make it to the top well he probably did and dropped
Struck down by the strength of the will
Aint nothin left here partner just the dust of a plague
That has left this whole town afraid
From now on thisll be where youre from
Let the dead bury the dead Your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade
Gather round you people and a story I will tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of Pima Indians a proud and a peaceful band
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
Now Ira s folks were hungry and their farms when crops of weeds
But when war came he volunteers and forgot the white man s greed
Call him Drunken Ira Hayes he won t answer anymore
Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes call him Drunken Ira Hayes he won t answer anymore
Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war
They started up Iwo Jima Hill  men
But only  lived to walk back down that hill again
And when the fight was over and the old glory raised
One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes
Call him Drunken Ira Hayes he won t answer anymore
Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him Drunken Ira Hayes he won t answer anymore
Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Now Ira returned a hero celebrated throughout the land
He was wined and speeched and honored everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian no money crops no chance
And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the wind did the Indian s dance
Call him Drunken Ira Hayes he won t answer anymore
Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him Drunken Ira Hayes he won t answer anymore
Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war
And Ira started drinking hard jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you d throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning alone in the land he had fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes
Call him Drunken Ira Hayes he won t answer anymore
Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes call him Drunken Ira Hayes he won t answer anymore
Not the whiskeydrinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Down along the cove
I spied my true love comin my way
Down along the cove
I spied my true love comin my way
I say Lord have mercy mama
It sure is good to see ya  comin  today
Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
She said Lord have mercy honey
Im so glad youre my boy
Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand
Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand
Evrybody watchin us a go by
Knows were in love yes and they understand
I pulled out for San Anton
I never felt so good
My woman said shed meet me there
And of course I knew she would
The coachman he hit me for my hook
And he asked me my name
I give it to him right away
Then I hung my head in shame
I come into Pittsburgh
At sixthirty flat
I found myself a vacant seat
An I put down my hat
Whats the matter Molly dear
Whats the matter with your mound
Whats it to ya Moby Dick
This is chicken town
I bought my girl
A herd of moose
One she could call her own
Well she came out the very next day
To see where they had flown
Im going down to Tennessee
Get me a truck or something
Gonna save my money and rip it up
Now I come in on a Ferris wheel
And boys I sure was slick
I come in like a ton of bricks
Laid a few tricks on them
Going back to Pittsburgh
Count up to thirty
Round that horn and ride that herd
Gonna thread up
Well it ain t no use to sit and wonder why babe
If you don t know by now
And it ain t no use to sit and wonder why babe
It will never do anyhow
When your rooster s a crowing at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I ll be gone
You re the reason why I m traveling on
But don t think twice it s all right
An it ain t no use in turnin  on your light baby
The light I never knowed
An it ain t no use in turnin  on your light baby
I m on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin  I could do or say
To try and make you change your mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But don t think twice it s all right
Well it ain t no use in calling out my name gal
Like you never done before
It ain t no use in calling out my name gal
I can t hear you any more
I m athinking and awondering walking down the road
I once loved a woman a child I m told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don t think twice it s all right
So long honey baby
Where I m bound I cannot tell
But goodbye s too good a word gal
So I ll just kinda say Fare thee well
Now I m not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done a lot better but I don t mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don t think twice it s all right
There is a ship and it sails on the sea
Loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I m in
I know not if I sink or swim
I leaned my back up against an oak
Thinking it was a trusty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
Just like my own false love to me
Oh love is gentle love is kind
Gay as a jewel when first it s new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like some morning dew
Im getting weary looking in my babys eyes
When shes near me shes so hard to recognize
I finally realize theres no room for regret
True love true love true love tends to forget
Hold me baby be near
You told me that youd be sincere
Every day of the years like playing Russian roulette
True love true love true love tends to forget
Youre a tearjerker baby but Im under your spell
Youre a hard worker baby and I know you well
But this weekend in hell is making me sweat
True love true love true love tends to forget
You belong to me baby without any doubt
Dont forsake me baby dont sell me out
Dont keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet
True love true love true love tends to forget
Come baby find me come baby
Remind me of where I once begun
Come baby show me show me you know me
Tell me you re the one
Come baby rock me Rock me
Come on baby and lock me
Into the shadows of your heart
Come baby teach me Teach me
Come baby and reach me
Let the music start Let the music start
As I travel down life s pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious father loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old homes scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Tell me where have you been my blue eyed son
Where have you been my darling young one
I ve stumbled up on the side of twelve misty mountains
I ve walked and I ve crawled over six crooked highways
I ve stepped out in the middle of seven sad forests
I ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
But I tell ya it s hard yeah it s hard well it s hard
Oh it s hard girl
It s a hard rain s gonna fall
Tell me what did you see my blueeyed son
What did you see my darling young one
I saw a black branch dripping with blood all around it
I saw a room full of men with their hammers bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
Well it s hard yes it s hard yes it s hard
Whoa yeah
It s a hard rain s gonna fall
Tell me what did you hear my blueeyed son
What did you hear my darling young one
I heard one hundred drummers hands that were blazing
Ten thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Well it s hard yes it s hard yeah it s hard
Oh it s hard yeah
It s a hard rain s gonna fall
Well what ll you do now my blue eyed son
What ll you do now my darling young one
Well I ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding the waters
But I ll know my song well and I sure won t forget it
Cause it s hard yes it s hard well it s hard
Oh yeah
It s a hard rain s gonna fall
Youre the one that reaches me
Youre the one that I admire
Every time we meet together
My soul feels like its on fire
Nothing matters to me
And theres nothing I desire
Cept you yeah you
Nothing round here I care to try for
Cept you yeah you
Got nothing left to live or die for
Cept you yeah you
Theres a hymn I used to hear
In the churches all the time
Make me feel so good inside
So peaceful so sublime
And theres nothing to remind me of that
Old familiar chime
Cept you uh huh you
Used to play in the cemetery
Dance and sing and run when I was a child
Never seemed strange
But now I just pass mournfully by
That place where the bones of life are piled
I know something has changed
Im a stranger here and no one sees me
Cept you yeah you
Nothing much matters or seems to please me
Cept you yeah you
Nothing hypnotizes me
Or holds me in a spell
Everything runs by me
Just like water from a well
Everybody wants my attention
Everybodys got something to sell
Cept you yeah you
Done laid around done stayed around

Summer s almost gone winter s coming on
Done laid around done stayed around

Done laid around done stayed around
This old town too long
And it seems like I ve got to travel on

Alberta let your hair hang low

Than your apron can hold
If you d only let your hair hang low
Alberta what s on your mind

You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time

Alberta don t you treat me unkind
Oh my heart is so sad

Alberta don t you treat me unkind

If not for you
Babe I couldn t even find the door
I couldn t even see the floor
I d be sad and blue
If not for you
If not for you
Babe the night would see me wide awake
The day would surely have to break
It would not be new
If not for you
Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star a star dancin  in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringin  through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song a song high above the tree
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm mighty king
Do you know what I know
A Child a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
A Child a Child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light
Been beat up and battered  round
Been sent up and I ve been shot down
You re the best thing that I ve ever found
Handle me with care
Reputation s changeable
Situation s tolerable
Baby you re adorable
Handle me with care
I ve been fucked off and I been fooled
I ve been robbed and ridiculed
In daycare centers and night schools
Handle me with care
Been stuck in airports terrorized
Sent to meetings hypnotized
Overexposed commercialized
Handle me with care
I ve been uptight and made a mess
I ll clean it up myself I guess
Oh the sweet smell of success
Handle me with care
Crash on the levee mama
Water s going to overflow
Swamp s going to rise
No boat s going to row
Now you can train on down
To Williams Point
You can bust your feet
You can rock this joint
Now don t you try an  move me
You re just going to lose
There s a crash on the levee
And mama you ve been refused
Well it s sugar for sugar
And salt for salt
If you go down in the flood
It s going to be your own fault
Well that high tide s rising
Mama don t you let me down
Pack up your suitcase
Mama don t you make a sound
Now it s king for king
Queen for queen
It s going to be the meanest flood
That anybody s seen
Father of night Father of day
Father who taketh the darkness away
Father who teacheth the bird to fly
Builder of rainbows up in the sky
Father of loneliness and pain
Father of love and Father of rain
Father of day Father of night
Father of black Father of white
Father who build the mountain so high
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky
Father of time Father of dreams
Father who turneth the rivers and streams
Father of grain Father of wheat
Father of cold and Father of heat
Father of air and Father of trees
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories
Father of minutes Father of days
Father of whom we most solemnly praise
Someones got it in for me theyre planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish theyd cut it but when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I cant help it if Im lucky
People see me all the time and they just cant remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas images and distorted facts
Even you yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
I couldnt believe after all these years you didnt know me any better than that
Sweet lady
I threw the IChing yesterday it said there d be some thunder at the well
I haven t tasted peace and quiet for so long it seems like living hell
Theres a lone soldier on the hill watching falling raindrops pour
You d never know it to look at him at the final shot he won the war
After losing every battle
I woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Hoofbeats pounding in my head at breakneck speed and making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
One day youll be in the ditch flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle
It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasnt enough to change my heart
Now everythings a little upside down as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
Whats good is bad whats bad is good youll find out when you reach the top
Youre on the bottom
I noticed at the ceremony that you left your bags behind
The driver came in after you left he gave them all to me and then he resigned
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned
You didn t trust me for a minute babe I ve never known the Spring to turn so quickly into Autumn
We pushed each other a little too far and one day it just turned into a raging storm
The hound dog bayed beyond your trees as I was packing up my uniform
Well I figured Id lost you anyway why go on Whats the use
In order to get in a word with you
Id have had to come up with some kind of excuse
And it just struck me kind of funny
I ve been doublecrossed too much at times I think I ve almost lost my mind
Ladykillers load dice on me behind my back while imitators steal me blind
You close your eyes and pout your lips and slip your fingers from your glove
You can have the best there is but it s going to cost you all your love
You won t get it for money
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a gypsy queen
Wiggle wiggle wiggle all dressed in green
Wiggle wiggle wiggle till the moon is blue
Wiggle till the moon sees you
Wiggle wiggle wiggle in your boots and shoes
Wiggle wiggle wiggle you got nothing to lose
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a swarm of bees
Wiggle on your hands and knees
Wiggle to the front wiggle to the rear
Wiggle till you wiggle right out of here
Wiggle till it opens wiggle till it shuts
Wiggle till it bites wiggle till it cuts
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a bowl of soup
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a rolling hoop
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a ton of lead
Wiggleyou can raise the dead
Wiggle till youre high wiggle till youre higher
Wiggle till you vomit fire
Wiggle till it whispers wiggle till it hums
Wiggle till it answers wiggle till it comes
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like satin and silk
Wiggle wiggle wiggle like a pail of milk
Wiggle wiggle wiggle rattle and shake
Wiggle like a big fat snak
Early one morning the sun was shining
And he was laying in bed
Wondering if she d changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said that their lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama s homemade dress
Papa s bank book wasn t big enough
He was standing at the side of the road
Rain falling on his shoes
Heading out for the old East Coast
Radio blasting the news
Straight on through
Tangled up in blue
She was married when they first met
To a man four times her age
He left her penniless in a state of regret
It was time to bust out of the cage
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out west
Splitting up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at him
As he was walking away
Saying I wish I could tell you all the things
That I never learned to say
He said That s all right baby I love you too
But we were tangled up in blue
He had a steady job and a pretty face
And everything seemed to fit
One day he could just feel the waste
He put it all down and split
And he drifted down to New Orleans
Where they treated him like a boy
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge
He nearly drowned in Delacroix
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He had one too many lovers and
None of them were too refined
All except for you
But you were tangled up in blue
She was working in the blinding light
And I stopped in for a drink
I just kept looking at her face so white
I didn t know what to think
Later on when the crowd thinned out
I was getting ready to leave
She was standing there right beside my chair
Saying What s that you got up your sleeve
I said Nothing baby and that s for sure
She leaned down into my face
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her
As she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was snow all winter and no heat
Revolution was in the air
And one day all of his slaves ran free
Something inside of him died
The only thing I could do was be me
And get on that train and ride
And when it all came crashing down
I was already south
I didn t know whether the world was flat or round
I had the worst taste in my mouth
That I ever knew
Tangled up in blue
So now I m going on back again
Maybe tomorrow or maybe next year
I gotta find someone among the women and men
Whose destiny is unclear
Some are masters of illusion
Some are ministers of the trade
All of the strong delusion
All of their beds are unmade
Me I m still heading towards the sun
Trying to stay out of the joint
We always did love the very same one
We just saw her from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue
Winterlude Winterlude oh darling
Winterlude by the road tonight
Tonight there will be no quarreling
Everything is gonna be all right
Oh I see by the angel beside me
That love has a reason to shine
Youre the one I adore come over here and give me more
Then Winterlude this dude thinks youre fine
Winterlude Winterlude my little apple
Winterlude by the corn in the field
Winterlude lets go down to the chapel
Then come back and cook up a meal
Well come out when the skating rink glistens
By the sun near the old crossroads sign
The snow is so cold but our love can be bold
Winterlude dont be rude please be mine
Winterlude Winterlude my little daisy
Winterlude by the telephone wire
Winterlude its making me lazy
Come on sit by the logs in the fire
The moonlight reflects from the window
Where the snowflakes they cover the sand
Come out tonight everything will be tight
Winterlude this dude thinks youre grand
Well I had to move fast
And I couldnt with you around my neck
I said Id send for you and I did
What did you expect
My hands are sweating
And we havent even started yet
Ill go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about
Someday maybe
Ill remember to forget
Im going to get my coat
I feel the breath of a storm
Theres something Ive got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I dont know
Has anybody seen my love
You want to talk to me
Go ahead and talk
Whatever you got to say to me
Wont come as any shock
I must be guilty of something
You just whisper it into my ear
Madame Butterfly
She lulled me to sleep
In a town without pity
Where the water runs deep
She said Be easy baby
There is nothing worth stealing in here
Youre the one Ive been looking for
Youre the one thats got the key
But I cant figure out whether Im too good for you
Or youre too good for me
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I dont know
Has anybody seen my love
Well theyre not showing any lights tonight
And theres no moon
Theres just a hotblooded singer
Singing Memphis in June
While theyre beating the devil out of a guy
Whos wearing a powderblue wig
Later hell be shot
For resisting arrest
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness
What looks large from a distance
Close up is never that big
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year
All our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
Next year
All our troubles will be miles away
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then
We ll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the yuletide gay
Next year
All our troubles will be miles away
Once again as in olden days
Happy gold days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star
Upon the highest bow
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Sad Im asittin on the railroad track
Watching that old smokestack
Train is aleavin but it wont be back
Years ago we hang around
Watching trains roll through the town
Now that train is agraveyard bound
Where we go up in that North Country
Lakes and streams and mines so free
I had no better friend than he
Something happened to him that day
I thought I heard a stranger say
I hung my head and stole away
A diesel truck was headin down
Carryin  up a heavy load
Left him on a Utah road
They carried him back to his hometown
His mother cried his sister moaned
Listening to them church bells tone
A diesel truck was rollin  slow
Pullin  down a heavy load
It left him on a Utah road
II sung the last verse for ya because I missed the words the first time I sung them about the truck
Ol black Bascom doesnt break no mirrors
Cold black water dog make no tears
You say you love me with what may be love
Dont you remember making baby love
Got your steam drill bit and youre looking for some kid
To get it to work for you like your ninepound hammer did
But I know that you know that I know that you show
Something is tearing up your mind
Hey John come and get me some candy goods
Shucks it sure feels like its in the woods
Spend some time on your January trips
You got tombstone moose up and your graveyard whips
If youre anxious to find out when your friendships gonna end
Come on baby Im your friend
And I know that you know that I know that you show
Something is tearing up your mind
Oh we bone the editor cant get rid
But his painted sled instead its a bed
Yes I see you on your window ledge
But I cant tell just how far away you are from the edge
And anyway youre just gonna make people jump and roar
Watcha wanna go and do that for
For I know that you know that I know that you know
Something is tearing up your mind
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Drumming in the morning in the evening theyll be coming for you
Ten thousand men on the move
Ten thousand men on the move
None of them doing nothin that your mama wouldnt disapprove
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
All clean shaven all coming in from the cold
Hey Who could your lover be
Hey Who could your lover be
Let me eat off his head so you can really see
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Standing at my window wishing me Goodnight
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Each one of m got seven wives each one of m just out of jail
Ten thousand women all sweepin my room
Ten thousand women all sweepin my room
Spilling my buttermilk sweeping it up with a broom
Black Jack Davey come ariden  on back
Awhistling loud and merry
Made the woods around him ring
And he charmed the heart of a lady
Charmed the heart of a lady
How old are you my pretty little miss
How old are you my honey
She answered to him with a lovin  smile
I ll be sixteen come Sunday
Be sixteen come Sunday
Come and go with me my pretty little miss
Come and go with me my honey
Take you where the grass grows green
You never will want for money
You never will want for money
At night the boss came home
Inquiring about this lady
The servant spoke before she thought
She s been with Black Jack Dave
Rode off with Black Jack Davey
Well saddle for me my coal black stud
He s speedier than the gray
I rode all day and I ll ride all night
And I ll overtake my lady
I ll bring back my lady
Well he rode all night till the broad daylight
Till he came to a river raging
And there he spied his darling bride
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey
Would you forsake your house and home
Would you forsake your baby
Would you forsake your husband too
To go with Black Jack Davey
Rode off with Black Jack Davey
Well I ll forsake my house and home
And I ll forsake my baby
I ll forsake my husband too
For the love of Black Jack Davey
Ride off with Black Jack Davey
Last night I slept in a feather bed
Between my husband and baby
Tonight I lay on the river banks
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Love my Black Jack Davey
Well met well met my own true love
Well met well met cried she
I ve just returned from the salt salt sea
And it s all for the love of thee
I could have married a King s daughter there
She would have married me
But I have forsaken my King s daughter there
It s all for the love of thee
Well if you could have married a King s daughter there
I m sure you re the one to blame
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I m sure he s a fine young man
Forsake forsake your house carpenter
And come away with me
I ll take you where the green grass grows
On the shores of sunny Italy
So up she picked her babies three
And gave them kisses one two three
Saying take good care of your daddy while I m gone
And keep him good company
Well they were sailing about two weeks
I m sure it was not three
When the younger of the girls she came on deck
Saying she wants company
Well are you weeping for your house and home
Or are you weeping for your babies three
Well I m not weeping for my house carpenter
I m weeping for my babies three
Oh what are those hills yonder my love
They look as white as snow
Those are the hill of heaven my love
You and I ll never know
Oh what are those hills yonder my love
They look as dark as night
Those are the hills of hellfire my love
Where you and I will unite
Oh twice around went the gallant ship
I m sure it was not three
When the ship all of a sudden it sprung a leak
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea
Well its always been my nature to take chances
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
To the tune of a concertina
Blood dryin in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
But whatever it could be makes me think youve seen me before
Angelina
His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
And the head of a hyena
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek
If you can read my mind why must I speak
No I have heard nothing about the man that you seek
Angelina
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
With your subpoena
When you cease to exist then who will you blame
Ive tried my best to love you but I cannot play this game
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
Angelina
Theres a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone
Your servants are half dead youre down to the bone
Tell me tall men where would you like to be overthrown
Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
Hes surrounded by Gods angels and shes wearing a blindfold
And so are you Angelina
I see pieces of men marching trying to take heaven by force
I can see the unknown rider I can see the pale white horse
In Gods truth tell me what you want and youll have it of course
Just step into the arena
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
Pass the tree of smoke pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weeping in unholy places
Angelina
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I m a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go
Cut on runway number nine big  set to go
I m stuck here on the ground where the cold winds blow
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes my friend she s rolling down at last
Hear the mighty engines roar see the silver bird on high
She s away and westward bound far above the clouds she ll fly
Where the morning rain don t fall and the sun always shines
She ll be flying over my home in about three hours time
This old airport s got me down it s no earthly good to me
Because I m stuck here on the ground cold and drunks as I might be
You can t hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I d best be on my way in the early morning rain
Old man sailing in a dinghy boat
Down there
Old man down is baiting a hook
On there
Gonna pull man down on a suckling hook
Gonna pull man into the suckling brook
Oh yeah
Now hes underneath that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah
Under that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah
Thats underneath that tree
Theres gonna be just you and me
Underneath that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah
I push him back and I stand in line
Oh yeah
Then I hush my Sadie and stand in line
Oh yeah

Underneath that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah
Now whos on the table whos to tell me
Oh yeah
Whos on the table whos to tell me
Oh yeah
Who should I tell oh who should I tell
The fortynine of you like bats out of hell
Oh underneath that old apple suckling tree
They say Eat drink and be merry
Take the bull by the horns
I keep seeing visions of you a lily among thorns
Everything looks a little far away to me
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap
Too much information about nothing
Too much educated rap
Its just like you told me just like you said it would be
The moon rising like wildfire
I feel the breath of a storm
Something I got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm
Just got back from a city of flaming red skies
Everybody thinks with their stomach
Theres plenty of spies
Every street is crooked they just wind around till they disappear
Madame Butterfly she lulled me to sleep
Like an ancient river
So wide and deep
She said Be easy baby aint nothin worth stealing in here
Youre the one Ive been waiting for
Youre the one I desire
But you must first realize
Im not another man for hire
I can hear that hotblooded singer
On the bandstand croon
Poisoned Love Red Roses for a Blue Lady and Memphis in June
While theyre beating the devil out of a guy whos wearing a powder blue wig
I been to Babylon
I gotta confess
I could still hear the voice crying in the wilderness
What looks large from a distance close up is never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine
You think you know the smile on her lips
The thrill and the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you ll ever know about her
You think you ll find heaven of bliss
In each caress in each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you ll ever know about her
You stole her love from me one day
You didn t care how it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be
You think she s yours to have and to hold
Someday you ll learn when her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you ll ever know about her
Well the rainman comes with his magic wand
And the judge says Mona cant have no bond
And the walls collide Mona cries
And the rainman leaves in the Wolfmans disguise
Well the undertaker in his midnight suit
Says to the masked man Aint you cute
Well the mask man he gets up on the shelf
And he says You aint so bad yourself
Well jumping Judy cant go no higher
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire
Rasputin hes so dignified
He touched the back of her head an he died
Well Phaedra with her looking glass
Stretching out upon the grass
She gets all messed up and she faints
Thats cause shes so obvious and you aint
If youre travelin  in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds
Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hairs hangin  long
For thats the way I remember her best
Im awondering if she remembers me at all
Many times Ive often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
If youre travelin  in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
I had a pony her name was Lucifer How much longer
I had a pony her name was Lucifer How much how much how much longer
She broke her leg and needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more than it hurted her
Sometimes I wonder what s going on with Miss X How much longer
Sometimes I wonder what s going on with Miss XHow much how much how much longer
She s got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the girl s gonna do to me next
Everybody say you re using voodoo your feet walk by themselves
Everybody say you re using voodoo I ve seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh baby that god you re praying to is gonna give you back what you re wishing on someone else
Come over here pony I wanna climb up one time on you

Come and listen for a moment lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail
Now the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge says he
Oh for life Jim Jones I m sending you
Across the stormy sea
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don t get too gay in Botany Bay
Or else you ll surely hang
Or else you ll surely hang says he
And after that Jim Jones
It s high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones
And our ship was high upon the sea
Then pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I d rather have joined that pirate ship
Than gone to Botany Bay
With the storms ragin  round us
And the winds ablowin  gale
I d rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales
Now it s day and night and the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
And it s by and by I ll slip my chains
Well into the bush I ll go
And I ll join the bush rangers there
Jack Donohue and co
And some dark night when everything
Is silent in the town
I ll shoot those tyrants one and all
I ll gun the flogger down
Oh I ll give the law
A little shock
Remember what I say
And they ll yet regret they ve sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay
Well you re coming down High Street walking in the sun
You make the dead man rise and holler she s the one
Jolene Jolene
Baby I am the king and you re the queen
Well it s a long old highway don t ever end
I ve got a Saturday night special I m back again
I ll sleep by your door lay my life on the line
You probably don t know but I m going to make you mine
Jolene Jolene
Baby I am the king and you re the queen
I keep my hands in my pocket I m moving along
People think they know but they re all wrong
You re something nice I m going to grab my dice
I can t say I haven t paid the price
Jolene Jolene
Baby I am the king and you re the queen
Well I found out the hard way I ve had my fill
You can t find somebody with his back to a hill
Those big brown eyes they set off a spark
When you hold me in your arms things don t look so dark
Jolene Jolene
Baby I am the king and you re the queen
Oh me and my cousin one Arthur McBride
As we went awalking down by the seaside
Mark now what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning
Now for recreation we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp
For the day being pleasant and charming
Good morning good morning the Sergeant he cried
And the same to you gentlemen we did reply
Intending no harm but meant to pass by
For it being on Christmas morning
But says he My fine fellows if you will enlist
Ten guineas in gold I ll stick to your fist
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
And drink the king s health in the morning
For a soldier he leads a very fine life
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
And he always lives pleasant and charming
And a soldier he always is decent and clean
In the finest of clothing he s constantly seen
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
And sup on thin gruel in the morning
But says Arthur I wouldn t be proud of your clothes
For you ve only the lend of them as I suppose
But you dare not change them one night for you know
If you do you ll be flogged in the morning
And although that we re single and free
We take great delight in our own company
We have no desire strange places to see
Although that your offers are charming
And we have no desire to take your advance
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
For you d have no scruples for to send us to France
Where we would get shot without warning
Oh no says the Sergeant I ll have no such chat
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats
For if you insult me with one other word
I ll cut off your heads in the morning
And Arthur and I we soon drew our hogs
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
We flung them as far as we could in the tide
Now take them up devils cried Arthur McBride
And temper their edge in the morning
And the little wee drummer we flattened his bow
And we made a football of his rowdydowdow
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning
And we having no money paid them off in cracks
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
And left them for dead in the morning
And so to conclude and to finish disputes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the morning
Oh me and my cousin one Arthur McBride
As we went awalking down by the seaside
Mark now what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning
If you ever go to Houston
Better walk right
Keep your hands in your pockets
And your gunbelt tight
You ll be asking for trouble
If you re looking for a fight
If you ever go to Houston
Boy you better walk right
If you re ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar
You better watch out for
The man with the shining star
Better know where you re going
Or stay where you are
If you re ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar
I know these streets
I ve been here before
I nearly got killed here
During the Mexican war
Something always
Keeps me coming back for more
I know these streets
I ve been here before
If you ever go to Dallas
Say hello to Mary Anne
Say I m still pulling on the trigger
Hanging on the best I can
If you see her sister Lucy
Say I m sorry I m not there
Tell her other sister Betsy
To pray the sinner s prayer
I got a restless fever
Burning in my brain
Got to keep riding forward
Can t spoil the game
The same way I leave here
Will be the way that I came
Got a restless fever
Burning in my brain
Mr Policeman
Can you help me find my girl
Last time I saw her
Was at the Magnolia Hotel
If you help me find her
You can be my pal
Mr Policeman
Can you help me find my girl
If you ever go to Austin
Fort Worth or San Antone
Find the bar rooms I got lost in
And send my memories home
Put my tears in a bottle
Screw the top on tight
If you ever go to Houston
You better walk rights
